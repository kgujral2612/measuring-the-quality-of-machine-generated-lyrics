Greedy\
(Verse 1)\
I always want more,\
I can never be satisfied.\
I\'m always looking for the next big thing,\
The next way to make more money,\
The next way to get more power.\
(Chorus)\
I\'m greedy, I\'m so greedy,\
I can\'t help but be greedy.\
I always want more,\
And I\'ll never be satisfied.\
(Verse 2)\
My greed has made me do things I\'m not proud of,\
I\'ve lied, I\'ve cheated, I\'ve stolen,\
I\'ve done anything to get what I want.\
(Chorus)\
I\'m greedy, I\'m so greedy,\
I can\'t help but be greedy.\
I always want more,\
And I\'ll never be satisfied.\
(Bridge)\
I know my greed is a problem,\
But I don\'t know how to stop it.\
I\'m addicted to the feeling of getting more,\
I\'m addicted to the power that comes with it.\
(Chorus)\
I\'m greedy, I\'m so greedy,\
I can\'t help but be greedy.\
I always want more,\
And I\'ll never be satisfied.\
(Outro)\
I\'m so greedy,\
I\'m going to ruin myself.\
I\'m going to lose everything,\
And it\'s all my fault.




I would rate these lyrics a 6 out of 10. The lyrics tell a story about a person who is consumed by their greed and the negative consequences it has had on their life. The use of repetition in the chorus emphasizes the theme of greed. The lyrics also incorporate the protagonist's feelings of addiction and power, making them more relatable to the audience. However, the lyrics lack metaphors or similes that could have made them more interesting. The rhyme scheme is also very basic, with a simple ABAB structure. The imagery is also limited, with only a few lines describing the protagonist's actions. Overall, the lyrics are decent but could benefit from more creative language and imagery.
