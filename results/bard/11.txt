Love is all I need\
(Verse 1)\
I\'ve been searching for something,\
Something to fill this empty space.\
I\'ve tried money, power, and fame,\
But they all left me feeling disgraced.\
(Chorus)\
But now I know what I need,\
It\'s all right here in front of me.\
Love is all I need,\
To make my life complete.\
(Verse 2)\
I used to think that I was strong,\
But I was only fooling myself.\
I needed someone to hold me close,\
And tell me that everything was going to be okay.\
(Chorus)\
But now I know what I need,\
It\'s all right here in front of me.\
Love is all I need,\
To make my life complete.\
(Bridge)\
I\'ve finally found my place in the world,\
And it\'s all because of you.\
You\'ve shown me what true love is,\
And I\'ll never be the same.\
(Chorus)\
So thank you for loving me,\
For making me feel complete.\
Love is all I need,\
And I\'ll never let you go.



I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics tell a story of the protagonist's search for something to fill an empty space in their life, and how they eventually realize that love is all they need. The lyrics also incorporate the protagonist's feelings of being lost and needing someone to hold them close. The use of imagery is limited, but the lyrics do create a sense of the protagonist's emotional state. The lyrics also have a clear rhyme scheme, which makes them more interesting. However, the lyrics lack metaphors or similes that could have made them more appealing to the audience's cognitive senses. Overall, the lyrics are good, but they could have been improved with more vivid imagery and metaphors.
