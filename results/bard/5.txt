You Are Not Alone\
(Verse 1)\
You feel like you\'re all alone\
Like no one understands you\
But I\'m here to tell you\
That you are not alone\
(Chorus)\
You are not alone\
I\'m here for you\
I know what you\'re going through\
And I\'m here to help\
(Verse 2)\
You\'ve been through so much\
You\'ve been hurt and you\'ve been scared\
But you\'re stronger than you think\
And you can get through this\
(Chorus)\
You are not alone\
I\'m here for you\
I know what you\'re going through\
And I\'m here to help\
(Bridge)\
You are not a burden\
You are not a mistake\
You are loved and you are cherished\
And you are not alone\
(Chorus)\
You are not alone\
I\'m here for you\
I know what you\'re going through\
And I\'m here to help\
(Outro)\
You are not alone\
I\'m here for you\
And together, we can get through this

The lyrics have a clear message of support and encouragement for someone who is feeling alone. The grammar is correct throughout the song. The lyrics do not have any metaphors or similes, but they do tell a story of someone who has been through a lot and is being reassured that they are not alone. The imagery is not very vivid, but the emotions of the protagonist are described well. The rhyme scheme is simple and follows an ABAB pattern, but it is effective in conveying the message of the song. Overall, the lyrics are good, but could benefit from more vivid imagery and a more complex rhyme scheme.
