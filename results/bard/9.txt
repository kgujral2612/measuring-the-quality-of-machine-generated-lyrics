Verse 1:\
Love is a journey,\
It\'s not always easy.\
There will be ups and downs,\
But it\'s worth it in the end.\

Love is a journey,\
And I\'m glad to be on it with you.\
I can\'t wait to see where it takes us,\
I know it will be amazing.\

We\'ve laughed together,\
We\'ve cried together,\
We\'ve grown together.\
And I know that we\'ll continue to grow,\
As long as we have each other.\
Chorus:\
Love is a journey,\
And I\'m glad to be on it with you.\
I can\'t wait to see where it takes us,\
I know it will be amazing.\

I know that there will be times when we want to give up,\
But I also know that we\'ll never give up on each other.\
We\'re in this together,\
And we\'ll get through it together.\

Love is a journey,\
And I\'m glad to be on it with you.\
I can\'t wait to see where it takes us,\
I know it will be amazing.\
Outro:\
I love you,\
And I will always love you.\
No matter what happens,\
I will always be here for you.


I would rate these lyrics a 5 out of 10. While the lyrics have a clear theme of love being a journey, they lack the use of metaphors or similes that could make them more interesting and appealing to the audience's cognitive senses. The lyrics also lack a story and imagery that could help the audience visualize the setting and background of the song. The feelings of the protagonist are expressed, but in a very plain and straightforward manner. The lyrics do have an interesting rhyme scheme, but that alone is not enough to make them good. Overall, the lyrics are simple and straightforward, but lack the depth and complexity that would make them stand out.
