Love Yourself\
\
(Verse 1)\
You\'ve been through so much\
You\'ve been hurt and you\'ve been lied to\
But you still have to love yourself\
No matter what anyone else says\
(Chorus)\
Love yourself, love yourself\
No matter what they say\
Love yourself, love yourself\
You are worthy of love\
(Verse 2)\
You are beautiful, you are smart, you are kind\
You are everything you need to be\
So don\'t let anyone tell you otherwise\
(Chorus)\
Love yourself, love yourself\
No matter what they say\
Love yourself, love yourself\
You are worthy of love\
(Bridge)\
You are the only person you have to live with for the rest of your life\
So make sure you love yourself\
(Chorus)\
Love yourself, love yourself\
No matter what they say\
Love yourself, love yourself\
You are worthy of love\
(Outro)\
Love yourself, and never let anyone tell you otherwise




I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear message of self-love and self-acceptance, which is relatable and important. The lyrics are grammatically correct and easy to understand. However, the lyrics lack a story and imagery, which could have made them more interesting. The lyrics do incorporate feelings and a metaphor of "you are the only person you have to live with for the rest of your life", which is a good use of cognitive senses. The rhyme scheme is simple and plain, which is not very interesting. Overall, the lyrics are good but could have been improved with more storytelling and interesting rhyme schemes.
