The World is Yours\
(Verse 1)\
There once was a man named Jack, he worked at the local grocery store\
He didn\'t think his life had much worth, always felt small, ignored, poor\
No matter how hard he tried, he could never catch a break in life\
Thought his dreams would forever stay locked and hidden from daylight until late\
Then came the morning of a new dawn, after months of slumber gone\
Jack heard words echoed through town that changed everything, everything so strong:\
"The world is yours!" those voices cried, so very clear and true\
And with that Jack stood straight up tall, ready to begin brand new, renewed\
He went outside, ready to face whatever lay ahead unshackled\
Realized now his future was made by his own two hands, unfazed and unafraid, elated.\
Chorus:\
Oh oh! The world is yours my friend, go claim it, bend it to your needs!\
Everyone\'s got purpose underneath that shining sun above, waiting to succeed!\
With passion, dedication and drive, greatness shall be thine\
Fulfill your destiny, be proud as can be, make the most of every breath you seize!\
Oh oh! The world is yours my friend, go grasp it, mold it to success!\
Never doubt your potential, let others marvel at progress blessed!\
(Verse 2)\
At first, the going seemed slow, fear kept trying to overthrow\
Each step taken showed doubts held sway still deep down inside Jack\'s chest\
Until a chance encounter introduced a girl with shining eyes\
She shared her story and how she fought off her own disguised cries\
Of self-doubt and hesitation, showing him that yes, indeed he too could dare\
To reach beyond common limits set by society, culture, or school\'s rule, a rare breed\
Together they inspired a crowd, ignited hearts ablaze\
They dared individuals far and wide to join them now, without pause, and raise\
Voices high for unity, to bring the change desired\
Make dreams come true, with courage guiding every move\
Bring a better tomorrow, side by side.\
Chorus:\
Oh oh! T




I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics tell a story of a man named Jack who feels small and ignored, but is inspired to pursue his dreams after hearing encouraging words. The story is relatable and the feelings of self-doubt and fear are expressed well. The use of metaphors or similes is limited, but the imagery of the shining sun and the girl with shining eyes is effective. The lyrics also incorporate a message of unity and bringing about change. The rhyme scheme is interesting with an ABABCC pattern in the verses and an AABB in the chorus. However, there are a few grammatical errors such as "fulfill" being spelled as "fulfil" and "breath" being spelled as "breathe".
