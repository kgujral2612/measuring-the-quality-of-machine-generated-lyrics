The Shadow Within\
Verse 1:\
In every heart lies shadows deep, where hidden demons sleep\
Until pride awakens them, a poisonous potion leaks\
Greed nurses their ambition, pushing morals aside\
Blinding truth and wisdom, a selfish web entwined\
Chorus:\
A shadow within us all, that whispers words of vice\
A dark companion in our souls, pulling strings so nice\
But if only we could see, through deceptions, to reality\
The path to righteousness, guiding light ahead would seem clear to me\
Verse 2:\
Envies\' flames ignite relationships, causing rifts and strife\
Uncontrollably burning bridges, and trust, leaving nothing but life\
Lustful cravings enslave us, driven by insatiable hungers\
Leaving those who truly care, scarred and abandoned by our lurches



I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear story and message about the negative aspects of human nature, specifically the "shadow" within us all. The use of metaphors such as "hidden demons" and "poisonous potion" add depth to the lyrics and appeal to the audience's cognitive senses. The imagery of "burning bridges" and "scarred and abandoned" also helps to visualize the consequences of succumbing to these negative traits. However, the lyrics could benefit from more varied and interesting rhyme schemes to make them more engaging.
