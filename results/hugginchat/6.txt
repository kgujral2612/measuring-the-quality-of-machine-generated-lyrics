Still Grieving\
Verse 1:\
There was a time where laughter filled this place\
Now all that\'s left are traces of emptiness\
Memories flood back, overwhelm my mind\
Missing parts that leave behind deep voids so blind\
Chorus:\
Why am I still grieving? It\'s been years now gone\
Yet absence remains, leaving wounds yet raw\
Unfinished chapters haunt, and tears they flow\
From eyes that once sparkled but know only sorrow\
Verse 2:\
Once there were dreams, hopes shone so bright\
Those days seem far, so very out of sight\
Doubts arise, questions cloud my thoughts\
Am I really healing, moving towards new starts?\
Chorus:\
Why am I still grieving? Is it fear or guilt?\
Or simply can\'t forget all those things built?\
These feelings linger, slowly fade along,\
Leaving scars which will never completely mend their wrong.


I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear story and express the protagonist's feelings of grief and loss. The use of imagery is also present, with the line "Memories flood back, overwhelm my mind" creating a vivid picture of the protagonist's state of mind. The rhyme scheme is also interesting, with the use of ABAB in the verses and AABB in the chorus. However, there are a few areas where the lyrics could be improved. The use of metaphors or similes is lacking, which could make the lyrics more engaging for the audience. Additionally, the lyrics could benefit from more varied language and phrasing to make them more interesting.
