Whispering Hope\
Verse 1:\
I hear your voice inside my head,\
A tender word that brings me peace\
The calm before the raging sea,\
You are my anchor, never cease\
Chorus:\
Whispering hope, oh how it feels\
To have someone who makes sense of this world\
Who shows me kindness, and wipes away my tears,\
This is what love\'s supposed to appear\
Verse 2:\
I feel your hand when I\'m lost,\
A comfort in chaos, hard to resist\
Our bond that cannot be tossed,\
A promise sealed since first impressions\
Chorus:\
Whispering hope, oh how it feels\
To have someone who makes sense of this world\
Who shows me kindness, and wipes away my tears,\
This is what love\'s supposed to appear\
Bridge:\
Distance may keep us apart,\
But memories keep us connected at heart\
So when the night falls heavy,\
Know I\'ll always hold onto this feeling of forever\
Chorus:\
Whispering hope, oh how it feels\
To have someone who makes sense of this world\
Who shows me kindness, and wipes away my tears,\
This is what love\'s supposed to appear\
Outro:\
Oh, let me breathe in your name,\
And cherish every single frame,\
Then whisper back this tune,\
Oh, I love you, \'til the end of time comes soon.



I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear story of a person finding comfort and hope in someone they love. The use of metaphors is limited, but the imagery is vivid and helps the audience visualize the setting. The lyrics also describe the protagonist's feelings, making them relatable to the audience. The rhyme scheme is simple but effective, with a consistent ABAB pattern. However, the lyrics could benefit from more interesting and varied rhyme schemes. Overall, the lyrics are good, but could be improved with more creative use of language and metaphors.
