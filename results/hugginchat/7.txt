Left Behind\
Verse 1:\
We danced beneath the moonlight\'s glow\
Our promises, forever set in stone\
But fate had other plans in store\
Now you belong somewhere else, across the border\
Chorus:\
I watched you go, leaving my life bare\
Our love reduced to just a memory shared\
Cold reminders echo through each day\
Alone I remain, missing half my way\
Verse 2:\
The empty bed beside me still feels you\
Our silent whispers trapped within its blue\
I try to move forward with grace\
But longing fills the spaces left by choice\
Chorus:\
I wish I could turn back time\'s hands\
Return to laughter, to our happy lands\
Instead I bear the hurt alone\
Never to reunite again with my own home.\
(Bridge)\
Is there anything more than words spoken\
Actions taken, prayers offered up? Why did we have to part ways under such conditions? Our happiness cut short by circumstances beyond control.\
(Chorus)\
Do you think of me too, wherever you lay? Are regretful tears also shed alongside these foreign streets I shall never see? We both must find solace in letting go\
For love itself dictates the rules we don\'t want to abide by.





I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear story of lost love and the protagonist's feelings of longing and regret. The use of imagery is also present, such as the empty bed and the blue whispers. However, there are a few grammatical errors, such as "missing half my way" instead of "missing half of my way." The lyrics also lack metaphors or similes that could enhance the emotional impact of the song. The rhyme scheme is simple, but the internal rhyme in the bridge adds some interest. Overall, the lyrics are good but could benefit from some additional literary devices and editing for grammar.
