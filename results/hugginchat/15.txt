Here We Go Again\
Verse 1 (Pre Chorus):\
Another night under the moonlight\
We\'ll unleash our passion, fire ignites\
Dance until morning breaks out soon\
When we hear familiar melodies from DJ tunes\
Pre Chorus:\
Every beat drops, hearts explode, we flow\
Sing along, belting high and low\
The rhythm takes hold deep within soul\
Energy rises through each instrument bold\
Chorus:\
Here we go again, baby\
Hands in the air, feel alive\
One more time, we\'ll raise it higher\
Until the end, we\'ll still defy\
Bridge:\
Memories blurred together, mixed emotions swirl\
Fear may try, but won\'t get into\
Our vibe of unity, pure devotion\
This moment only happens once in a lifetime station\
Chorus:\
Here we go again, baby\
Raisin\' hell, we won\'t stray\
No regrets left behind us, glory days remain\
As the beat fades away, we\'ll stay the same... forever young\
Breakdown/Post Crescendo:\
So let\'s keep going strong\
Forget yesterday\'s wrong\
The future waits, but we\'ve already conquered everything before it comes\
Now, let\'s rock the floor one last time\
Before leaving this place, just turn around\
Embrace those nearby, shout it loud: "Thank you!"\
Then slowly disperse back home to sweet dreams




I would rate these lyrics a 6 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear story of a night out with friends, and the imagery of dancing under the moonlight is vivid. The lyrics also incorporate feelings of unity and pure devotion. However, the lyrics lack metaphors or similes that appeal to the audience's cognitive senses. The rhyme scheme is also quite simple, with a basic ABAB structure. The lyrics could benefit from more interesting and complex rhymes. Overall, the lyrics are decent but could use some improvement in terms of literary devices and rhyme scheme.
