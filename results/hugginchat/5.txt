To the Moon and Back\
(Verse 1)\
I know you think my voice might break apart\
But if I wait for things to right themselves, I\'m afraid to start\
My words are like a bird with broken wings\
They fly despite their flaws because they have nothing left but to sing\
So as the silence takes hold tonight\
And everyone around falls into slumber tight\
I pick these strings, I play these keys\
And my soul escapes just like a child fleeing his tears\
\
(Chorus)\
I send my notes to find you in your sleep\
Like gentle kisses softly caressing lips to keep\
You safe and warm until the morning dawns\
Until our bodies meet, souls intertwined by songs and moons\
Because my dearest friend, there\'s always time\
To make amends before we turn out fine\
You\'re never far, not really gone\
Just waiting for our next adventure to begin, come home\
\
(Verse 2)\
There\'s nothing wrong, we just need some air\
Time apart doesn\'t mean we don\'t still dare\
To dream of each other in quiet hours\
When shadows dance across the darkened floor\
Maybe you remember how the night would lay its hand across your brow\
And say hello as we whispered secrets under covers\
Well, I do too, and that\'s why I wrote you this little ditty\
So when you miss the laughter that we used to live in, just remind yourself\
That there\'s a melody connecting us, linking hearts that rhyme\
Though miles may separate them, they both belong to you and me\
Like rhymes repeating verse for all of history to see.\
\
(Bridge)\
Oh the sweet sadness of growing older\
And learning how we lose ourselves like flowers bolder\
But love remains a constant force to reckon with\
An elixir keeping us young, giving us the guts\
To tell each other all we feel and share\
Our joys and sorrows, hopes, and yes, our fears\
To look in each other\'s eyes, and see\
Not only yesterday but also the possibility\
Of tomorrow, of taking off at last\
To somewhere new, or maybe back, reborn in light cast by moon




I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have good imagery and feelings, and the rhyme scheme is interesting. The use of metaphors and similes is limited, but the story is well-defined. However, there are a few grammatical errors, such as "flowers bolder" instead of "flowers bold" and "light cast by moon" instead of "light cast by the moon." Overall, the lyrics are good, but could benefit from some minor editing.
