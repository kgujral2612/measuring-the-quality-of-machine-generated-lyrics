Two Hearts Beating As One\
Verse 1:\
Like twin birds taking flight\
Soaring higher without any sight\
Of an obstacle or worry\
They roam freely side by side\
Chorus:\
Two hearts beating as one\
A symphony of love has begun\
Beautiful melodies intertwined\
Eternal rhythms we reside\
Verse 2:\
When trouble strikes with fury\
In moments cold and lonely\
You stand firm, offering strength\
Together we weather the storm length\
Chorus:\
Two hearts beating as one\
A symphony of love has begun\
Beautiful melodies intertwined\
Eternal rhythms we reside\
Bridge:\
As stars above sparkle bright\
So does the radiance we share tonight\
Two souls illuminated by fire\
Shining everlastingly tire\
Chorus:\
Two hearts beating as one\
A symphony of love has begun\
Beautiful melodies intertwined\
Eternal rhythms we reside




I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a consistent rhyme scheme and no grammatical errors. The use of metaphors and similes is limited, but the imagery is vivid and helps the audience visualize the setting. The lyrics tell a story of two hearts beating as one, which makes them cogent. The description of the protagonist's feelings is also present in the lyrics. However, the lyrics lack a unique or interesting perspective, and the rhyme scheme is simple and predictable. Overall, the lyrics are good but could benefit from more creative and unique language.
