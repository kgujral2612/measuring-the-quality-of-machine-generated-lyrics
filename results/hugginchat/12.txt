Temptations of Vice\
Verse 1:\
Pride creeps into our hearts, blind to all advice\
Bringing ego and arrogance, we think we know it all\
Greed consumes us deep within, always seeking more\
Never satisfied, forever wanting something new\
Chorus:\
Vices take control, dragging us down their path\
We lose ourselves in sin, unable to break free from this wrath\
But there\'s still hope to find salvation, if we can learn\
To overcome these temptations, before they bring us harm\
Verse 2:\
Envy burns inside us, feeding on others\' gains\
Jealous thoughts consume our minds, we want everything they have\
Lust leads astray with dangerous desires, never satiated\
Forever chasing pleasure, leaving love behind\
Chorus:\
Vices take control, dragging us down their path\
We lose ourselves in sin, unable to break free from this wrath\
But there\'s still hope to find salvation, if we can learn\
To overcome these temptations, before they bring us harm\
Bridge:\
Gluttony takes hold, overindulgence at the cost\
Health neglected as we indulge, no end to this selfish feast\
Sloth traps us in complacency, fearing change and risk\
These weights holding us back, preventing progress, growth and bliss\
Chorus:\
Vices take control, dragging us down their path\
We must stand up now, and fight against them with all our might\
Forget old ways and errors, seek a brighter future ahead\
By overcoming these temptations, we\'ll finally shed them off, once and for all



I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear theme of the temptations of vices and the consequences that come with them. The lyrics also incorporate metaphors and similes such as "Pride creeps into our hearts, blind to all advice" and "Envy burns inside us, feeding on others' gains". The lyrics also tell a story and have a clear message of hope and redemption. However, the lyrics could benefit from more vivid imagery to help the audience visualize the setting and the emotions of the protagonist. The rhyme scheme is also fairly simple, with an ABAB structure, which could be more interesting. Overall, the lyrics are good but could be improved with more vivid imagery and a more complex rhyme scheme.
