Lost in Time\
Verse 1:\
Time stood still, frozen in pain\
My heart beat like an old drum\
You were the rhythm in my chest\
Your voice echoed in my head\
Chorus:\
I miss you like the sun misses the sky\
Like birds miss the warmth of summer breeze\
Without you I\'m nothing but a lie\
Wandering aimlessly, Lost in Time please\
Verse 2:\
Try to recall the last words said\
They vanished into thin air instead\
It\'s just fragments of you and me\
Scattered amongst memories free\
Chorus:\
I miss you like the sun misses the sky\
Like birds miss the warmth of summer breeze\
Without you I\'m nothing but a lie\
Wandering aimlessly, Lost in Time cries\
Bridge:\
But then it hits me full force\
Every moment spent without your force\
I see flashbacks of moments passed\
And I realize... You won\'t come back after all this time has passed\
Chorus:\
I miss you like the sun misses the sky\
Like birds miss the warmth of summer breeze\
Without you I\'m nothing but a lie\
Wandering aimlessly, Lost in Time dies





I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear story of missing someone and feeling lost without them. The use of imagery is present in lines such as "My heart beat like an old drum" and "birds miss the warmth of summer breeze". The feelings of the protagonist are also expressed well in lines such as "Without you I'm nothing but a lie". However, the lyrics could benefit from more metaphors or similes to make them more interesting. The rhyme scheme is simple but effective, with a consistent ABAB pattern. Overall, the lyrics are good but could use some more creative elements to make them stand out.
