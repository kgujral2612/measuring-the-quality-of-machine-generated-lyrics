Let\'s Have Some Fun\
Verse 1 (Chorus):\
We can dance like there\'s no tomorrow\
Shake our hips and shimmy all night long\
Don\'t worry \'bout mistakes we make now\
Just follow your heart and live on impulse\
Chorus:\
Let\'s have some fun tonight, yeah\
Tonight we\'re living life alright\
Let the music move us close\
With every step, we glow so brightly, ho\
Bridge:\
And if anyone asks why we\'re smiling wide\
Tell them "Life\'s short, better shine inside!"\
We don\'t need to wait for fate decides\
To take control and create our own chances, ride\
Chorus:\
Let\'s have some fun tonight, yeah\
Tonight we\'re feeling love, love light\
Inside, outside, no need for hiding\
All that matters is we keep trying\
Outro/Coda:\
So come on everyone, lift your hands\
Come join us here, where love lands\
On this beautiful journey we begin\
A joyous treasure, never lose who we am\
Ending Tag (Ad lib): Let\'s have some fun, oh yeah



I would rate these lyrics a 5 out of 10. While there are no grammatical errors, the lyrics lack depth and originality. The use of cliches such as "let the music move us close" and "follow your heart" make the lyrics feel generic. The lyrics do incorporate a theme of living in the moment and enjoying life, but it is not presented in a unique or interesting way. The rhyme scheme is also very basic and lacks creativity. However, the lyrics do incorporate imagery such as "glow so brightly" and "smiling wide" which helps the audience visualize the scene. Overall, the lyrics are average and could benefit from more originality and depth.
