Score: 7/10

This song has a clear story that talks about the protagonist's life journey. The language is straightforward and free of grammatical errors which is impressive. The use of metaphors or similes is lacking in this song, and the imagery might seem a bit vague, but it successfully conveys the idea of a journey. The feelings and emotions of the protagonist are not expressed, but it's clear that they feel scared and they have to show strength to keep going. The rhyme scheme is plain (ABCB), but it fits well with the message of the song. Although the song could use some improvement, the clear message and the positivity of the lyrics make it an enjoyable listen.
