Stay With Me\
\
Verse 1:\
Lost in my thoughts, you\'re all I see\
Can\'t escape this feeling, that you\'re meant to be\
Thinking \'bout the times, when we were apart\
Now I\'ve got you, you\'re the missing piece of my heart\
\
Chorus:\
Stay with me, till the end of time\
I\'ll be there for you, forever mine\
Together we\'ll conquer, every mountain, every climb\
Stay with me, till the end of time\
\
Verse 2:\
Now I\'m all alone, with nothing left to hold\
Trying to find my way, in a world so cold\
Thinking \'bout the times, when we were apart\
Now I\'ve got you, you\'re the missing piece of my heart\
\
Chorus:\
Stay with me, till the end of time\
I\'ll be there for you, forever mine\
Together we\'ll conquer, every mountain, every climb\
Stay with me, till the end of time\
\
Bridge:\
Every night I pray, for a love that\'s true\
Hoping you\'ll be mine, forever and ever too\
\
Chorus:\
Stay with me, till the end of time\
I\'ll be there for you, forever mine\
Together we\'ll conquer, every mountain, every climb\
Stay with me, till the end of time\
\
Outro:\
Stay with me, till the end of time\
I\'ll be there for you, forever mine





I would rate these lyrics a 5 out of 10. While the lyrics are grammatically correct, they lack complexity and depth. There are no real metaphors or similes that catch the listener's attention and force them to think about the meaning of the song. The story and imagery are simplistic, and the feelings are stated directly rather than being described in an indirect way. The rhyme scheme is very basic (ABCB) and does not add much interest to the lyrics. However, the message of the lyrics is clear and understandable, which is why the rating is not lower.
