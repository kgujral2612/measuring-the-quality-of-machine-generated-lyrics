Chasing Dreams\
\
Verse 1:\
I\'m on a journey to find my way\
To chase the dreams that I can\'t shake\
I don\'t know what the future holds\
But I won\'t let go of my goals\
\
Chorus:\
Chasing dreams, it\'s what we do\
Chasing dreams, they\'ll come true\
Chasing dreams, we\'ll find our way\
Chasing dreams, every day\
\
Verse 2:\
I\'m climbing mountains and crossing seas\
I\'m facing fears and insecurities\
I don\'t know what\'s around the bend\
But I know I\'ll reach the end\
\
Chorus:\
Chasing dreams, it\'s what we do\
Chasing dreams, they\'ll come true\
Chasing dreams, we\'ll find our way\
Chasing dreams, every day\
\
Bridge:\
It\'s easy to get lost in the fray\
And forget why we\'re here today\
But we have to keep on going\
And keep the fire glowing\
\
Chorus:\
Chasing dreams, it\'s what we do\
Chasing dreams, they\'ll come true\
Chasing dreams, we\'ll find our way\
Chasing dreams, every day\
\
Outro:\
Chasing dreams, it\'s our destiny\
Chasing dreams, we\'ll set them free\
Chasing dreams, let\'s seize the day\
Chasing dreams, come what may



I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics follow a consistent theme of chasing dreams and persevering through obstacles. The rhyme scheme is simple but effective with a consistent ABAB pattern. There are no grammatical errors. The lyrics incorporate feelings of determination and motivation, making them relatable to the audience. However, the lyrics lack imagery and a detailed story and there are no metaphors or similes that would make them more interesting. Nonetheless, the song encourages the listeners to follow their dreams and the consistently repeated chorus makes it easy to learn and sing along.
