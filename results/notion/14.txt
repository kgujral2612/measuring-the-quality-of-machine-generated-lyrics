I would rate these lyrics a 4 out of 10. While the lyrics are grammatically correct, they do not incorporate any metaphors or similes, tell a story, or contain detailed imagery or emotions. The lyrics are also quite repetitive, using the same phrases in both verses and the chorus. The only slightly interesting aspect of these lyrics is the use of the phrase "till we die" which creates a slightly darker tone, but this is not expanded upon. The rhyme scheme is simply AABB, which is uninspired. Overall, the lyrics lack depth and originality.
