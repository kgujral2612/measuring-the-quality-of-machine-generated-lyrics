Verse 1:\
Life is full of twists and turns\
And we can\'t avoid the bumps and burns\
But I know that every step we take\
Will lead us to a better place\

Keep moving forward, don\'t give up\
Keep moving forward, fill your cup\
Keep moving forward, one step at a time\
Keep moving forward, let your light shine\

We all have our own unique path\
And it\'s easy to get lost in the aftermath\
But we have to keep on going\
And keep the fire glowing\
\
Chorus:\
Keep moving forward, don\'t give up\
Keep moving forward, fill your cup\
Keep moving forward, one step at a time\
Keep moving forward, let your light shine\

Bridge:\
It\'s easy to get caught up in the past\
And forget that every day can be a blast\
But we have to keep our eyes on the prize\
And let go of the things that weigh us down inside\

Keep moving forward, don\'t give up\
Keep moving forward, fill your cup\
Keep moving forward, one step at a time\
Keep moving forward, let your light shine\
\
Outro:\
Keep moving forward, don\'t look back\
Keep moving forward, stay on track\
Keep moving forward, you\'ve got this\
Keep moving forward, let love and light persist




I would rate these lyrics a 6/10. The lyrics convey a positive message of perseverance, which is always a good thing. The rhyming is consistent, which is good, but the rhyme scheme is quite simple and predictable (AAAA, BBBB, etc). There are no distinctive or imaginative metaphors or similes that make the lyrics stand out. However, the lyrics tell a cogent story and incorporate imagery, making it easy to visualize the protagonist's journey. The lyrics also describe the protagonist's feelings, which make the lyrics relatable. Overall, the lyrics are good, but could use more creative writing techniques to make them more interesting and memorable.
