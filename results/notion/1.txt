Notion\
Verse 1:\
I\'ve got this notion in my head\
A thought that won\'t escape\
It swirls around, it fills me up\
And it won\'t let me escape\
\
Chorus:\
Notion, notion, what\'s the plan?\
Notion, notion, can you understand?\
Notion, notion, it won\'t let me be\
Notion, notion, please set me free\
\
Verse 2:\
I try to push it to the side\
But it\'s always on my mind\
It whispers to me in my dreams\
And it\'s getting hard to find\
\
Chorus:\
Notion, notion, what\'s the plan?\
Notion, notion, can you understand?\
Notion, notion, it won\'t let me be\
Notion, notion, please set me free\
\
Bridge:\
I don\'t know where this notion leads\
But I know I have to be\
Strong enough to face the truth\
And let it set me free\
\
Chorus:\
Notion, notion, what\'s the plan?\
Notion, notion, can you understand?\
Notion, notion, it won\'t let me be\
Notion, notion, please set me free\
\
Outro:\
Notion, notion, I\'ll face the fear\
Notion, notion, I\'ll let it clear\
Notion, notion, I\'ll find my way\
Notion, notion, I\'ll seize the day



I would rate these lyrics a 6. The lyrics use the repetition of "notion" to create a catchy chorus and the bridge introduces the idea that the protagonist needs to face their fears and the truth. However, the lyrics do not have any deep metaphors or similes and the story is not very clear. The imagery is also lacking, making it difficult for the audience to fully visualize the emotions and thoughts of the protagonist. The lyrics do express the protagonist's feelings about their notion but do not delve into the reasons behind them. The rhyme scheme is consistent throughout the song but it is a simple ABAB pattern. Overall, the lyrics could be improved to make them more interesting and meaningful.
