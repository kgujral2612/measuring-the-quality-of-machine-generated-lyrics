I would rate this song lyrics a 5 out of 10. The lyrics lack metaphors or similes, any story or imagery but they do express the protagonist's feelings in some measure. The lyrics are rather simple and do not incorporate any advanced rhyme schemes. Although there are no grammatical errors, the lyrics might not capture the attention of the audience enough. The lyrics could benefit from more depth by including at least one other aspect among metaphors, story, imagery, or interesting lyrics.
