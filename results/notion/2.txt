Embrace the Change\
\
Verse 1:\
I\'m standing on the edge of something new\
A world I\'ve never seen\
I\'m scared of what the future holds\
But I know I have to lean\
\
Chorus:\
Embrace the change, don\'t be afraid\
Embrace the change, it\'s time to be brave\
Embrace the change, take a chance\
Embrace the change, let\'s start this dance\
\
Verse 2:\
I\'ve been stuck in the same old place\
Afraid to take a risk\
But I know that nothing stays the same\
And I can\'t resist\
\
Chorus:\
Embrace the change, don\'t be afraid\
Embrace the change, it\'s time to be brave\
Embrace the change, take a chance\
Embrace the change, let\'s start this dance\
\
Bridge:\
It\'s easy to stay where we are\
And never take a chance\
But life is full of twists and turns\
And we have to take a stance\
\
Chorus:\
Embrace the change, don\'t be afraid\
Embrace the change, it\'s time to be brave\
Embrace the change, take a chance\
Embrace the change, let\'s start this dance\
\
Outro:\
Embrace the change, it\'s time to move on\
Embrace the change, let\'s sing a new song\
Embrace the change, let\'s start today\
Embrace the change, let\'s find our way



I would rate the lyrics a 6. The lyrics contain a clear message of embracing change which makes them cogent. The song also contains a story of the protagonist who is hesitant to leave their comfort zone but ultimately decides to take a chance. The lyrics incorporate feelings of fear and courage which makes them more relatable to the audience. However, the song lacks metaphors, similes, and imagery that could have added depth and detail to the message. The rhyme scheme is simplistic (AABB) and does not add any interest to the lyrics. The lyrics contain no grammatical errors which is a plus.
