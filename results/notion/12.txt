The Temptation\
\
Verse 1:\
Pride, the temptation that blinds the eye.\
A feeling of superiority that makes us fly.\
Thinking \'bout the times, when we were kings,\
But the pride inside us, it\'s the devil\'s wings.\
\
Chorus:\
The temptation, it\'s hard to resist.\
The feeling of being the best, always persists.\
Can\'t escape this feeling of superiority,\
It\'s the devil\'s game, a game of futility.\
\
Verse 2:\
Greed, the temptation that enslaves the soul.\
A desire for wealth, that makes us lose control.\
Thinking \'bout the times, when we were poor,\
But the greed inside us, it\'s the devil\'s lure.\
\
Chorus:\
The temptation, it\'s hard to resist.\
The feeling of being rich, always persists.\
Can\'t escape this feeling of greed,\
It\'s the devil\'s game, a game of need.\
\
Bridge:\
Every night I pray, for a brighter day.\
Hoping to escape, the devil\'s way.\
\
Chorus:\
The temptation, it\'s hard to resist.\
The feeling of being the best, always persists.\
Can\'t escape this feeling of superiority,\
It\'s the devil\'s game, a game of futility.





I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. 

The lyrics have a clear message about the dangers of pride and greed, making them cogent and incorporating the story factor. The first verse contains a metaphor comparing the pride to devil's wings which appeals to the cognitive senses of the audience. Similarly, in the second verse, there is a metaphor comparing greed to the devil's lure. These metaphors make the lyrics more interesting and help to capture the audience's attention.

The chorus is repetitive and has a plain rhyme scheme of ABAB, which takes away from the appeal of the lyrics, and in turn, the rating.

The lyrics do incorporate some feelings and emotions, especially in the bridge where the protagonist prays for a brighter day, indicating their desire to escape the devil's temptation. However, more description and emotion could be added to the lyrics to make them even more relatable to the audience and tug at their heartstrings.

Overall, the lyrics are decent but could benefit from more imagery, an improved rhyme scheme, and more vivid descriptions of the protagonist's feelings.
