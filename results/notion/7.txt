Hoping you\'ll come back to me, and take this pain away\

Rating: 5/10

The lyrics have a coherent story and express the feelings of the protagonist. However, the lyrics lack metaphors or similes and the imagery is very basic. The song does not incorporate an interesting rhyme scheme and the lyrics are quite ordinary. Also, the lyrics seem repetitive in some parts, and there is not much depth to the emotions being expressed. The presence of grammatical errors cannot be determined as they are not present in the lyrics given.
