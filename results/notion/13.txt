The Seven Sins\
\
Verse 1:\
Wrath, the sin that consumes the heart.\
A feeling of anger, that tears us apart.\
Thinking \'bout the times, when we were calm,\
But the wrath inside us, it\'s the devil\'s bomb.\
\
Chorus:\
The seven sins, they\'re hard to ignore.\
The feeling of anger, it\'s hard to restore.\
Can\'t escape this feeling of hate,\
It\'s the devil\'s game, a game of fate.\
\
Verse 2:\
Lust, the sin that enslaves the mind.\
A desire for pleasure, that makes us blind.\
Thinking \'bout the times, when we were pure,\
But the lust inside us, it\'s the devil\'s lure.\
\
Chorus:\
The seven sins, they\'re hard to ignore.\
The feeling of pleasure, it\'s hard to restore.\
Can\'t escape this feeling of lust,\
It\'s the devil\'s game, a game of trust.\
\
Bridge:\
Every night I pray, for a brighter day.\
Hoping to escape, the devil\'s way.\
\
Chorus:\
The seven sins, they\'re hard to ignore.\
The feeling of anger, it\'s hard to restore.\
Can\'t escape this feeling of hate,\
It\'s the devil\'s game, a game of fate.\
\
Outro:\
The seven sins, they\'re hard to ignore.\
The feeling of pleasure, it\'s hard to restore.\
Can\'t escape this feeling of hate,\
It\'s the devil\'s game, a game of fate.




I would rate this song lyric a 6/10. The lyrics successfully incorporate the theme of the seven sins and incorporate a story by discussing each of the sins in the verses. The imagery of tearing apart and enslaving the mind reveals a detailed imagery, which is a great characteristic of good song lyrics. Additionally, the repetition of the chorus and the bridge at different points in the lyrics shows effective writing. However, the lyrics do not include metaphors or similes which could make it more interesting and appealing to the audience's cognitive senses. The rhyme scheme is straightforward and predictable with ABAB, and the lyrics do not use more complex rhyme schemes. Overall, while the lyrics have a coherent theme, they could be further improved with the addition of more literary devices and a more interesting rhyme scheme.
