Forever Yours\
\
Verse 1:\
Every time I see you, my heart skips a beat\
I can\'t help but smile, every time we meet\
Thinking \'bout the times, when we were apart\
Now I\'ve got you, you\'re the missing piece of my heart\
\
Chorus:\
Forever yours, till the end of time\
I\'ll be there for you, forever mine\
Together we\'ll conquer, every mountain, every climb\
Forever yours, till the end of time\
\
Verse 2:\
Now I\'m lost in your eyes, lost in your soul\
Trying to find my way, in a world so cold\
Thinking \'bout the times, when we were apart\
Now I\'ve got you, you\'re the missing piece of my heart\
\
Chorus:\
Forever yours, till the end of time\
I\'ll be there for you, forever mine\
Together we\'ll conquer, every mountain, every climb\
Forever yours, till the end of time\
\
Bridge:\
Every night I pray, for a love that\'s true\
Hoping you\'ll be mine, forever and ever too\
\
Chorus:\
Forever yours, till the end of time\
I\'ll be there for you, forever mine\
Together we\'ll conquer, every mountain, every climb\
Forever yours, till the end of time\
\
Outro:\
Forever yours, till the end of time\
I\'ll be there for you, forever mine




I would rate the lyrics a 6 out of 10 because while there is a clear expression of the protagonist's feelings and story, there are no metaphors or similes that make the lyrics interesting. The lyrics are also repetitive and lack any vivid imagery to help visualize the setting or environment. The rhyme scheme is simple and plain ABAB which makes it predictable. However, the lyrics are relatable for audiences because it is a love song that expresses the protagonist's desire to be forever with their loved one. Overall, the lyrics lack creativity and do not provide anything unique or interesting.
