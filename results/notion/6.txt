Broken Dreams\
\
Verse 1:\
I\'m sitting here alone, no one to call my own\
All the dreams I had, shattered like a stone\
Thinking \'bout the times, when you were by my side\
Now the memories haunt me, I\'ve got nowhere to hide\
\
Chorus:\
Broken dreams, shattered heart\
Wish we never had to part\
Tears falling down like rain\
Won\'t wash away the pain\
\
Verse 2:\
Now I\'m lost in time, searching for a sign\
Trying to find my way, in this life of mine\
Thinking \'bout the times, when you were by my side\
Now the memories haunt me, I\'ve got nowhere to hide\
\
Chorus:\
Broken dreams, shattered heart\
Wish we never had to part\
Tears falling down like rain\
Won\'t wash away the pain\
\
Bridge:\
Every night I pray, for a brighter day\
Hoping you\'ll come back to me, and take this pain away\
\
Chorus:\
Broken dreams, shattered heart\
Wish we never had to part\
Tears falling down like rain\
Won\'t wash away the pain\
\
Outro:\
Broken dreams, shattered heart\
Wish we never had to part\
Tears falling down like rain\
Won\'t wash away the pain


I would rate these lyrics a 6. The lyrics contain a story of heartbreak and loss which makes them cogent. The language used is simple and coherent, which makes them easy to understand. They also contain vivid imagery such as "Tears falling down like rain" and "shattered like a stone". However, the lyrics lack any metaphors or similes to appeal to the cognitive senses. The rhyme scheme is fairly simple and follows an ABAB format, with no internal rhymes. Although the lyrics express the protagonist's feelings of pain and longing well, there could be more detail to make them more relatable for the audience. Furthermore, no major grammatical errors are present.
