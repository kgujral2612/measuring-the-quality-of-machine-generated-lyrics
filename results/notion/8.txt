Now it\'s all gone, and I\'m lost forever\

Now it\'s all gone, and I\'m lost forever\

Fading memories, heart so heavy\
Wishing for a love that\'s steady\
Can\'t escape this pain, it\'s too much to carry\

Every night I pray, for a brighter day\
Hoping you\'ll come back to me, and take this pain away\

I would give this song lyrics a rating of 5. The lyrics have a consistent rhyme scheme which makes them somewhat interesting. The song also contains a story about the protagonist who is dealing with the pain of losing their lover. The feelings of the protagonist are expressed throughout the lyrics making them more relatable for the audience. However, the song lacks metaphors or similes that appeal to the cognitive senses of the audience. Additionally, the song does not have any imagery that helps the audience visualize the background or the setting of the song. Overall, the song has some good elements, but could benefit from more intricate language and figurative language.
