Memories of You\
Verse 1:\
I close my eyes and see your face\
The memories of you, I can\'t erase\
The love we shared, now just a dream\
My heart is shattered, it seems\
Chorus:\
Memories of you, haunting me\
The pain inside, won\'t set me free\
I miss you more than words can say\
My heart aches every single day\
Verse 2:\
The laughter we shared, the tears we cried\
The moments we cherished, now all gone by\
I wish I could turn back time\
And hold you close, just one more time\
Chorus:\
Memories of you, haunting me\
The pain inside, won\'t set me free\
I miss you more than words can say\
My heart aches every single day\
Bridge:\
I know I have to let you go\
But it\'s so hard, you know\
I\'ll keep your memories alive\
And cherish them, until the end of time\
Chorus:\
Memories of you, haunting me\
The pain inside, won\'t set me free\
I miss you more than words can say\
My heart aches every single day\
Outro:\
Memories of you, forever in my heart\
I\'ll love you always, even though we\'re apart.






I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear story of a lost love and the protagonist's feelings of missing the person. The use of imagery is present in lines such as "I close my eyes and see your face" and "The love we shared, now just a dream". The rhyme scheme is simple but effective in conveying the emotions of the protagonist. However, the lyrics could benefit from more metaphors or similes to make them more interesting and engaging for the audience. Additionally, the lyrics could use more varied vocabulary to avoid repetition and make the lyrics more dynamic.
