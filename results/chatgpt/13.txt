The Price We Pay\
Verse 1:\
Pride, the ego that we feed\
We think we\'re better, we don\'t concede\
Greed, the hunger that we breed\
We want it all, we don\'t take heed\
Chorus:\
The price we pay, it\'s never enough\
The seven vices, they\'re so tough\
We\'re only human, we make mistakes\
But we can change, before it\'s too late\
Verse 2:\
Wrath, the anger that we unleash\
We hurt others, we don\'t appease\
Envy, the jealousy that we seize\
We want what others have, we don\'t please\
Chorus:\
The price we pay, it\'s never enough\
The seven vices, they\'re so tough\
We\'re only human, we make mistakes\
But we can change, before it\'s too late\
Verse 3:\
Lust, the desire that we crave\
We lose our morals, we don\'t behave\
Gluttony, the excess that we save\
We indulge too much, we don\'t behave\
Chorus:\
The price we pay, it\'s never enough\
The seven vices, they\'re so tough\
We\'re only human, we make mistakes\
But we can change, before it\'s too late\
Verse 4:\
Sloth, the laziness that we embrace\
We procrastinate, we don\'t face\
The seven vices, they\'re all around\
But we can overcome, we can be unbound\
Chorus:\
The price we pay, it\'s never enough\
The seven vices, they\'re so tough\
We\'re only human, we make mistakes\
But we can change, before it\'s too late\
Outro:\
The price we pay, it\'s not worth it\
The seven vices, they don\'t permit\
We can be better, we can be kind\
We can leave the vices, we can unwind.



I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear theme of the seven deadly sins and how they affect us. The rhyme scheme is consistent throughout the song, which makes it easy to follow. The lyrics also incorporate a message of hope and change, which is a positive aspect. However, the lyrics lack vivid imagery and metaphors, which could have made the song more interesting. Additionally, the lyrics are repetitive, which can make the song monotonous. Overall, the lyrics are good, but they could have been improved with more creative language and less repetition.
