I would rate these lyrics a 6 out of 10. The lyrics are grammatically correct and tell a story about a night of partying and having fun. However, the lyrics lack metaphors or similes that appeal to the audience's cognitive senses. The imagery is also limited to the drinks flowing and the music being loud. The feelings of the protagonist are not described in detail, and the rhyme scheme is simple and predictable (ABAB). Overall, the lyrics are catchy and easy to sing along to, but they lack depth and complexity.
