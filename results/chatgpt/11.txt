I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a consistent theme of comparing love to a symphony, which creates a cohesive story. The use of imagery is also present, as the lyrics describe the rhythm of the heart and the tune of the soul. However, the lyrics lack metaphors or similes that could have made them more interesting. The rhyme scheme is also simple, with an ABAB pattern, which could have been more complex to make the lyrics more engaging. Overall, the lyrics are good, but could have been improved with more creative language.
