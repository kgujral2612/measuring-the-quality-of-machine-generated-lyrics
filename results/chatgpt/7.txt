Broken Heart\
Verse 1:\
My heart is broken, shattered in two\
The pain inside, I can\'t undo\
The love we had, now just a memory\
I\'m lost without you, can\'t you see?\
Chorus:\
Broken heart, can\'t be fixed\
The pain inside, just won\'t quit\
I thought we had forever\
But now we\'re apart, it\'s just whatever\
Verse 2:\
The nights are long, the days are cold\
The love we shared, now grown old\
I wish I could turn back time\
And make you mine, forever mine\
Chorus:\
Broken heart, can\'t be fixed\
The pain inside, just won\'t quit\
I thought we had forever\
But now we\'re apart, it\'s just whatever\
Bridge:\
I know I have to move on\
But it\'s so hard, you\'re gone\
I\'ll pick up the pieces, one by one\
And find a way, to carry on\
Chorus:\
Broken heart, can\'t be fixed\
The pain inside, just won\'t quit\
I thought we had forever\
But now we\'re apart, it\'s just whatever\
Outro:\
Broken heart, I\'ll mend someday\
And find a love, that\'s here to stay. 



I would rate these lyrics a 6 out of 10. The lyrics tell a story of heartbreak and loss, which is a good start. However, the lyrics lack metaphors or similes that could make them more interesting and relatable to the audience. The imagery is also limited, with only a few lines describing the state of the environment. The lyrics do express the protagonist's feelings, but in a very straightforward manner. The rhyme scheme is simple and predictable, which makes the lyrics less interesting. However, the lyrics are grammatically correct, which is a plus. Overall, the lyrics have potential but could benefit from more creative language and imagery.
