Verse 1:\
I never knew love could be so true\
Until I met you, my heart was blue\
You came into my life like a ray of light\
And made everything feel so right\
Chorus:\
Endless love, that\'s what we share\
A bond so strong, nothing can compare\
Together we\'ll face the world, hand in hand\
Our love will never fade, it will always stand\
Verse 2:\
Through the ups and downs, we\'ll stick together\
Our love will only grow stronger, forever and ever\
You\'re the missing piece that completes me\
With you by my side, I\'m where I\'m meant to be\
Chorus:\
Endless love, that\'s what we share\
A bond so strong, nothing can compare\
Together we\'ll face the world, hand in hand\
Our love will never fade, it will always stand\
Bridge:\
I\'ll love you till the end of time\
You\'re the one I want to call mine\
Our love is a flame that will never die\
Together we\'ll soar, we\'ll reach the sky\
Chorus:\
Endless love, that\'s what we share\
A bond so strong, nothing can compare\
Together we\'ll face the world, hand in hand\
Our love will never fade, it will always stand




I would rate these lyrics a 5 out of 10. While the lyrics are grammatically correct, they lack originality and depth. The lyrics do not tell a story or incorporate vivid imagery that helps the audience visualize the background or the setting of the song. The lyrics also do not make use of metaphors or similes that appeal to the audience's cognitive senses. The lyrics are straightforward and do not indirectly express emotions or show what's on the protagonist's mind. The rhyme scheme is plain and predictable, which makes the lyrics less interesting. However, the lyrics do incorporate a description of the protagonist's feelings, which makes the lyrics more relatable for the audience.
