I would rate these lyrics a 6 out of 10. While the lyrics are grammatically correct, they lack depth and originality. The lyrics do tell a story of a night out, but it is a common theme in music. The lyrics do not incorporate any metaphors or similes, and the imagery is limited to the setting of a party. The feelings of the protagonist are not expressed in detail, and the rhyme scheme is simple and predictable. However, the lyrics do have a catchy chorus and a positive message of enjoying the moment.
