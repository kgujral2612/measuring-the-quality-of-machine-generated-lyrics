Alone\
Verse 1:\
I\'m all alone, in this empty room\
The silence deafening, like a sonic boom\
The memories of you, still fresh in my mind\
The love we shared, now hard to find\
Chorus:\
Alone, in this world so cold\
The pain inside, never grows old\
I thought we had forever\
But now I\'m alone, it\'s just whatever\
Verse 2:\
The nights are long, the days are gray\
The love we shared, now gone away\
I wish I could turn back time\
And make you mine, forever mine\
Chorus:\
Alone, in this world so cold\
The pain inside, never grows old\
I thought we had forever\
But now I\'m alone, it\'s just whatever\
Bridge:\
I know I have to find my way\
And make it through, another day\
I\'ll find a love, that\'s true and real\
And heal my heart, so I can feel\
Chorus:\
Alone, in this world so cold\
The pain inside, never grows old\
I thought we had forever\
But now I\'m alone, it\'s just whatever\
Outro:\
Alone, but not forever\
I\'ll find a love, that\'s meant to be together.



I would rate these lyrics a 6 out of 10. The lyrics tell a story of heartbreak and loneliness, which is relatable to many people. The rhyme scheme is simple but effective, with a consistent ABAB pattern. The use of metaphors or similes is limited, but the line "The silence deafening, like a sonic boom" is a good example of a simile that appeals to the audience's cognitive senses. The imagery is also limited, but the line "The nights are long, the days are gray" creates a vivid picture of the protagonist's state of mind. The description of the protagonist's feelings is clear and relatable, but it lacks depth and complexity. The lyrics are grammatically correct, which is a plus. Overall, the lyrics are good but could benefit from more metaphors, imagery, and emotional depth.
