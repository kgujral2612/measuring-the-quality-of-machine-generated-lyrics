The Light Within\
Verse 1:\
Lost in the darkness, searching for a way\
Feeling so hopeless, can\'t see the light of day\
But deep down inside, there\'s a burning flame\
A light that shines bright, calling out your name\
Chorus:\
The light within, it\'s always there\
Guiding you through, the depths of despair\
Don\'t give up, don\'t lose your way\
Let the light within, lead you to a brighter day\
Verse 2:\
Life can be tough, and it can bring you down\
But don\'t let it break you, don\'t let it steal your crown\
For every storm, there\'s a silver lining\
And every challenge, is just a chance for shining\
Chorus:\
The light within, it\'s always there\
Guiding you through, the depths of despair\
Don\'t give up, don\'t lose your way\
Let the light within, lead you to a brighter day\
Bridge:\
It\'s easy to forget, the power that we hold\
To rise above, and be brave and bold\
So when you feel lost, and the world seems cold\
Remember the light within, and let it unfold\
Chorus:\
The light within, it\'s always there\
Guiding you through, the depths of despair\
Don\'t give up, don\'t lose your way\
Let the light within, lead you to a brighter day\
Outro:\
The light within, it\'s always shining bright\
A beacon of hope, in the darkest of night\
So hold on tight, and never let it go\
Let the light within, be your guiding glow.


I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear message of hope and perseverance, which is conveyed through the use of metaphors and imagery. The metaphor of the "light within" is used throughout the song to represent the inner strength and resilience of the protagonist. The lyrics also tell a story of overcoming challenges and not giving up, which makes them cogent. The rhyme scheme is simple but effective, with a consistent ABAB pattern. However, the lyrics could benefit from more vivid imagery and a more varied rhyme scheme to make them more interesting. Overall, the lyrics are good but could be improved with more attention to detail.
