Choose Love\
Verse 1:\
We live in a world where it\'s easy to hate\
Where anger and fear seem to dominate\
But I know there\'s a choice we can make\
To spread love instead of hate\

Choose love, when the world seems tough\
Choose love, when the road is rough\
Choose love, it\'s the only way\
To make a better world today\
Verse 2:\
It\'s so easy to be cynical\
To believe that love is too difficult\
But I know it\'s worth the fight\
To spread love with all our might\
Chorus:\
Choose love, when the world seems tough\
Choose love, when the road is rough\
Choose love, it\'s the only way\
To make a better world today\
Bridge:\
Love can change everything\
It\'s the power we all bring\
We can make a difference, you and me\
Just choose love, and you\'ll see\
Chorus:\
Choose love, when the world seems tough\
Choose love, when the road is rough\
Choose love, it\'s the only way\
To make a better world today\
Outro:\
It\'s time to break the hate chain\
Spread love, let it reign\
Together we can make a brighter day\
Just choose love, every step of the way.





I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear message of spreading love instead of hate, which is a good theme. The lyrics are grammatically correct and easy to understand. However, the lyrics lack metaphors or similes that could make them more interesting and appealing to the audience's cognitive senses. The lyrics also lack a story or imagery that could help the audience visualize the background or setting of the song. The lyrics do incorporate a description of the protagonist's feelings, but it is not very detailed. The rhyme scheme is simple and plain, which makes the lyrics less interesting. Overall, the lyrics have a good message, but could benefit from more creative and detailed language.
