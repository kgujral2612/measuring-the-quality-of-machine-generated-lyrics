The Temptation\
Verse 1:\
Pride, the sin that blinds our eyes\
We think we\'re better, we\'re in disguise\
Greed, the hunger that never dies\
We want it all, we\'re never satisfied\
Chorus:\
The temptation, it\'s hard to resist\
The seven vices, they persist\
We\'re only human, we make mistakes\
But we can change, before it\'s too late\
Verse 2:\
Wrath, the anger that consumes us\
We lose control, we can\'t discuss\
Envy, the jealousy that eats us\
We want what others have, we can\'t adjust\
Chorus:\
The temptation, it\'s hard to resist\
The seven vices, they persist\
We\'re only human, we make mistakes\
But we can change, before it\'s too late\
Verse 3:\
Lust, the desire that blinds us\
We lose our morals, we can\'t discuss\
Gluttony, the excess that harms us\
We indulge too much, we can\'t adjust\
Chorus:\
The temptation, it\'s hard to resist\
The seven vices, they persist\
We\'re only human, we make mistakes\
But we can change, before it\'s too late\
Verse 4:\
Sloth, the laziness that holds us back\
We procrastinate, we can\'t attack\
The seven vices, they\'re all around\
But we can overcome, we can be unbound\
Chorus:\
The temptation, it\'s hard to resist\
The seven vices, they persist\
We\'re only human, we make mistakes\
But we can change, before it\'s too late\
Outro:\
The temptation, it\'s always there\
But we can choose, we can be aware\
The seven vices, they don\'t define us\
We can be better, we can be righteous.


I would rate these lyrics a 7 out of 10. The lyrics have a clear theme of the seven deadly sins and how they affect us as humans. The use of metaphors and similes is limited, but the repetition of the chorus and the use of the seven vices as a motif throughout the song creates a cohesive story. The imagery is also present, especially in the lines "Wrath, the anger that consumes us" and "Gluttony, the excess that harms us". The lyrics also describe the protagonist's feelings, such as "Lust, the desire that blinds us" and "Sloth, the laziness that holds us back". The rhyme scheme is simple, but the repetition of the chorus and the use of the seven vices as a motif make the lyrics interesting. However, the lyrics could benefit from more varied and complex rhyme schemes and more vivid imagery. Overall, the lyrics are good, but there is room for improvement.
