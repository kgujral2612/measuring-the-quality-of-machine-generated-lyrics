Alone

Verse 1:
I'm all alone, in this empty room
The silence deafening, like a sonic boom
The memories of you, still fresh in my mind
The love we shared, now hard to find

Chorus:
Alone, in this world so cold
The pain inside, never grows old
I thought we had forever
But now I'm alone, it's just whatever

Verse 2:
The nights are long, the days are gray
The love we shared, now gone away
I wish I could turn back time
And make you mine, forever mine

Chorus:
Alone, in this world so cold
The pain inside, never grows old
I thought we had forever
But now I'm alone, it's just whatever

Bridge:
I know I have to find my way
And make it through, another day
I'll find a love, that's true and real
And heal my heart, so I can feel

Chorus:
Alone, in this world so cold
The pain inside, never grows old
I thought we had forever
But now I'm alone, it's just whatever

Outro:
Alone, but not forever
I'll find a love, that's meant to be together.
