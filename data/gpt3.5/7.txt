Broken Heart

Verse 1:
My heart is broken, shattered in two
The pain inside, I can't undo
The love we had, now just a memory
I'm lost without you, can't you see?

Chorus:
Broken heart, can't be fixed
The pain inside, just won't quit
I thought we had forever
But now we're apart, it's just whatever

Verse 2:
The nights are long, the days are cold
The love we shared, now grown old
I wish I could turn back time
And make you mine, forever mine

Chorus:
Broken heart, can't be fixed
The pain inside, just won't quit
I thought we had forever
But now we're apart, it's just whatever

Bridge:
I know I have to move on
But it's so hard, you're gone
I'll pick up the pieces, one by one
And find a way, to carry on

Chorus:
Broken heart, can't be fixed
The pain inside, just won't quit
I thought we had forever
But now we're apart, it's just whatever

Outro:
Broken heart, I'll mend someday
And find a love, that's here to stay.
