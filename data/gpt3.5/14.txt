Let's Get It Started

Verse 1:
Everybody's here, it's time to let loose
Forget about your worries, just enjoy the groove
The music's pumping, the drinks are flowing
Let's make some memories, let's keep it going

Chorus:
Let's get it started, let's have some fun
Dance until the morning sun
Let's get it started, let's make it wild
This is the night, let's go all out

Verse 2:
The DJ's spinning, the crowd is jumping
We're all in this together, no need for nothing
The energy's high, the vibe is right
Let's keep it moving, let's own the night

Chorus:
Let's get it started, let's have some fun
Dance until the morning sun
Let's get it started, let's make it wild
This is the night, let's go all out

Bridge:
We'll never forget this moment in time
Let's make it count, let's make it shine
We'll laugh, we'll dance, we'll sing along
This is our party, let's make it strong

Chorus:
Let's get it started, let's have some fun
Dance until the morning sun
Let's get it started, let's make it wild
This is the night, let's go all out

Outro:
Let's keep it going, let's keep it alive
This is our night, let's make it thrive
Let's get it started, let's have some fun
This is our party, let's make it one.
