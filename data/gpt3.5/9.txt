Endless Love

Verse 1:
I never knew love could be so true
Until I met you, my heart was blue
You came into my life like a ray of light
And made everything feel so right

Chorus:
Endless love, that's what we share
A bond so strong, nothing can compare
Together we'll face the world, hand in hand
Our love will never fade, it will always stand

Verse 2:
Through the ups and downs, we'll stick together
Our love will only grow stronger, forever and ever
You're the missing piece that completes me
With you by my side, I'm where I'm meant to be

Chorus:
Endless love, that's what we share
A bond so strong, nothing can compare
Together we'll face the world, hand in hand
Our love will never fade, it will always stand

Bridge:
I'll love you till the end of time
You're the one I want to call mine
Our love is a flame that will never die
Together we'll soar, we'll reach the sky

Chorus:
Endless love, that's what we share
A bond so strong, nothing can compare
Together we'll face the world, hand in hand
Our love will never fade, it will always stand
