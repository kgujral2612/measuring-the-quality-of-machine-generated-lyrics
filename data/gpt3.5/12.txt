The Temptation

Verse 1:
Pride, the sin that blinds our eyes
We think we're better, we're in disguise
Greed, the hunger that never dies
We want it all, we're never satisfied

Chorus:
The temptation, it's hard to resist
The seven vices, they persist
We're only human, we make mistakes
But we can change, before it's too late

Verse 2:
Wrath, the anger that consumes us
We lose control, we can't discuss
Envy, the jealousy that eats us
We want what others have, we can't adjust

Chorus:
The temptation, it's hard to resist
The seven vices, they persist
We're only human, we make mistakes
But we can change, before it's too late

Verse 3:
Lust, the desire that blinds us
We lose our morals, we can't discuss
Gluttony, the excess that harms us
We indulge too much, we can't adjust

Chorus:
The temptation, it's hard to resist
The seven vices, they persist
We're only human, we make mistakes
But we can change, before it's too late

Verse 4:
Sloth, the laziness that holds us back
We procrastinate, we can't attack
The seven vices, they're all around
But we can overcome, we can be unbound

Chorus:
The temptation, it's hard to resist
The seven vices, they persist
We're only human, we make mistakes
But we can change, before it's too late

Outro:
The temptation, it's always there
But we can choose, we can be aware
The seven vices, they don't define us
We can be better, we can be righteous.
