Good Times

Verse 1:
It's been a long week, we've been working hard
But now it's time to let down our guard
We're gonna have some fun, we're gonna make it right
We're gonna party until the morning light

Chorus:
Good times, we're gonna have some good times
Let's forget about our worries and our deadlines
Good times, we're gonna make some memories
This is our moment, let's live it carefree

Verse 2:
The drinks are flowing, the music's loud
We're all together, we're a happy crowd
We'll dance and sing, we'll laugh and play
This is our night, let's make it our way

Chorus:
Good times, we're gonna have some good times
Let's forget about our worries and our deadlines
Good times, we're gonna make some memories
This is our moment, let's live it carefree

Bridge:
We'll never forget this moment in time
Let's make it count, let's make it shine
We'll cherish these memories forevermore
Let's make it a night to remember for sure

Chorus:
Good times, we're gonna have some good times
Let's forget about our worries and our deadlines
Good times, we're gonna make some memories
This is our moment, let's live it carefree

Outro:
Let's keep the good times rolling, let's keep it alive
This is our night, let's make it thrive
Good times, we're gonna have some good times
This is our party, let's make it one of a kind.
