Lost in the Crowd

Verse 1:
I'm walking down the street
But I don't feel complete
I'm lost in the crowd
And I can't hear a sound

Chorus:
I'm searching for a way out
But I don't know where to go
I'm lost in the crowd
And I'm feeling so alone

Verse 2:
I'm trying to find my place
But I can't keep up the pace
I'm lost in the crowd
And I can't find my ground

Chorus:
I'm searching for a way out
But I don't know where to go
I'm lost in the crowd
And I'm feeling so alone

Bridge:
I need to break free
From this anonymity
I need to find my voice
And make my own choice

Chorus:
I'm searching for a way out
But I don't know where to go
I'm lost in the crowd
And I'm feeling so alone

Outro:
I'll keep on searching
Until I find my way
I won't be lost in the crowd
I'll make my own sound.
