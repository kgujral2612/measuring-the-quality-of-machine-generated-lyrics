Temptations of Vice

Verse 1:
Pride creeps into our hearts, blind to all advice
Bringing ego and arrogance, we think we know it all
Greed consumes us deep within, always seeking more
Never satisfied, forever wanting something new

Chorus:
Vices take control, dragging us down their path
We lose ourselves in sin, unable to break free from this wrath
But there's still hope to find salvation, if we can learn
To overcome these temptations, before they bring us harm

Verse 2:
Envy burns inside us, feeding on others' gains
Jealous thoughts consume our minds, we want everything they have
Lust leads astray with dangerous desires, never satiated
Forever chasing pleasure, leaving love behind

Chorus:
Vices take control, dragging us down their path
We lose ourselves in sin, unable to break free from this wrath
But there's still hope to find salvation, if we can learn
To overcome these temptations, before they bring us harm

Bridge:
Gluttony takes hold, overindulgence at the cost
Health neglected as we indulge, no end to this selfish feast
Sloth traps us in complacency, fearing change and risk
These weights holding us back, preventing progress, growth and bliss

Chorus:
Vices take control, dragging us down their path
We must stand up now, and fight against them with all our might
Forget old ways and errors, seek a brighter future ahead
By overcoming these temptations, we'll finally shed them off, once and for all
