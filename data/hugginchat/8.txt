Lost in Time

Verse 1:
Time stood still, frozen in pain
My heart beat like an old drum
You were the rhythm in my chest
Your voice echoed in my head

Chorus:
I miss you like the sun misses the sky
Like birds miss the warmth of summer breeze
Without you I'm nothing but a lie
Wandering aimlessly, Lost in Time please

Verse 2:
Try to recall the last words said
They vanished into thin air instead
It's just fragments of you and me
Scattered amongst memories free

Chorus:
I miss you like the sun misses the sky
Like birds miss the warmth of summer breeze
Without you I'm nothing but a lie
Wandering aimlessly, Lost in Time cries

Bridge:
But then it hits me full force
Every moment spent without your force
I see flashbacks of moments passed
And I realize... You won't come back after all this time has passed

Chorus:
I miss you like the sun misses the sky
Like birds miss the warmth of summer breeze
Without you I'm nothing but a lie
Wandering aimlessly, Lost in Time dies
