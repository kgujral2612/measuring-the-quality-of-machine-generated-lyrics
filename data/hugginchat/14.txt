Let's Have Some Fun

Verse 1 (Chorus):
We can dance like there's no tomorrow
Shake our hips and shimmy all night long
Don't worry 'bout mistakes we make now
Just follow your heart and live on impulse

Chorus:
Let's have some fun tonight, yeah
Tonight we're living life alright
Let the music move us close
With every step, we glow so brightly, ho

Bridge:
And if anyone asks why we're smiling wide
Tell them "Life's short, better shine inside!"
We don't need to wait for fate decides
To take control and create our own chances, ride

Chorus:
Let's have some fun tonight, yeah
Tonight we're feeling love, love light
Inside, outside, no need for hiding
All that matters is we keep trying

Outro/Coda:
So come on everyone, lift your hands
Come join us here, where love lands
On this beautiful journey we begin
A joyous treasure, never lose who we am

Ending Tag (Ad lib): Let's have some fun, oh yeah
