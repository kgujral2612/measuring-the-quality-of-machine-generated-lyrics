Left Behind

Verse 1:
We danced beneath the moonlight's glow
Our promises, forever set in stone
But fate had other plans in store
Now you belong somewhere else, across the border

Chorus:
I watched you go, leaving my life bare
Our love reduced to just a memory shared
Cold reminders echo through each day
Alone I remain, missing half my way

Verse 2:
The empty bed beside me still feels you
Our silent whispers trapped within its blue
I try to move forward with grace
But longing fills the spaces left by choice

Chorus:
I wish I could turn back time's hands
Return to laughter, to our happy lands
Instead I bear the hurt alone
Never to reunite again with my own home.

(Bridge)

Is there anything more than words spoken
Actions taken, prayers offered up? Why did we have to part ways under such conditions? Our happiness cut short by circumstances beyond control.

(Chorus)

Do you think of me too, wherever you lay? Are regretful tears also shed alongside these foreign streets I shall never see? We both must find solace in letting go
For love itself dictates the rules we don't want to abide by.
