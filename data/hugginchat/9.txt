An Ode to Love

Verse 1:
Oh, love, a force divine
That connects us one and all
A gentle touch upon our hearts
With each beat it calls us all

Chorus:
An ode to love, a sweet melody
A rhythm like a whisper in our ear
It softly dances, tender and true
And lifts us high above

Verse 2:
Oh, love, a guide from birth
Easing doubts and ending worries
With every step we take
Your warmth stays till the day breaks

Chorus:
An ode to love, a sweet melody
A rhythm like a whisper in our ear
It softly dances, tender and true
And lifts us high above

Bridge:
No matter time nor space
You bind us close, two spirits intertwine
Through joy and pain, your bond remains
Our hearts united, eternal sign

Chorus:
An ode to love, a sweet melody
A rhythm like a whisper in our ear
It softly dances, tender and true
And lifts us high above
