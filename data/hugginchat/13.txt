The Shadow Within

Verse 1:
In every heart lies shadows deep, where hidden demons sleep
Until pride awakens them, a poisonous potion leaks
Greed nurses their ambition, pushing morals aside
Blinding truth and wisdom, a selfish web entwined

Chorus:
A shadow within us all, that whispers words of vice
A dark companion in our souls, pulling strings so nice
But if only we could see, through deceptions, to reality
The path to righteousness, guiding light ahead would seem clear to me

Verse 2:
Envies' flames ignite relationships, causing rifts and strife
Uncontrollably burning bridges, and trust, leaving nothing but life
Lustful cravings enslave us, driven by insatiable hungers
Leaving those who truly care, scarred and abandoned by our lurches
