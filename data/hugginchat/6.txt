Still Grieving

Verse 1:
There was a time where laughter filled this place
Now all that's left are traces of emptiness
Memories flood back, overwhelm my mind
Missing parts that leave behind deep voids so blind

Chorus:
Why am I still grieving? It's been years now gone
Yet absence remains, leaving wounds yet raw
Unfinished chapters haunt, and tears they flow
From eyes that once sparkled but know only sorrow

Verse 2:
Once there were dreams, hopes shone so bright
Those days seem far, so very out of sight
Doubts arise, questions cloud my thoughts
Am I really healing, moving towards new starts?

Chorus:
Why am I still grieving? Is it fear or guilt?
Or simply can't forget all those things built?
These feelings linger, slowly fade along,
Leaving scars which will never completely mend their wrong.
