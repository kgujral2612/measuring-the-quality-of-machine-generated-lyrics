Two Hearts Beating As One

Verse 1:
Like twin birds taking flight
Soaring higher without any sight
Of an obstacle or worry
They roam freely side by side

Chorus:
Two hearts beating as one
A symphony of love has begun
Beautiful melodies intertwined
Eternal rhythms we reside

Verse 2:
When trouble strikes with fury
In moments cold and lonely
You stand firm, offering strength
Together we weather the storm length

Chorus:
Two hearts beating as one
A symphony of love has begun
Beautiful melodies intertwined
Eternal rhythms we reside

Bridge:
As stars above sparkle bright
So does the radiance we share tonight
Two souls illuminated by fire
Shining everlastingly tire

Chorus:
Two hearts beating as one
A symphony of love has begun
Beautiful melodies intertwined
Eternal rhythms we reside
