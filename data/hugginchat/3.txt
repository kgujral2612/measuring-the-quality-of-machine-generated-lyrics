Walk On Water

(Intro)
Water ripples softly, whispers gently kisses shore
Pebbles skip, splashing sweet melodies as sunbeams glower
A serene scene painted, but peace doesn't last
Storms rage, winds whirl, and calm subsides at last
But waves crash fierce against a rocky coastline, rebounding higher than before
Like life's struggles, they don't always tear us apart, often leaving us stronger yet explored
(Verse 1)
Once upon a time there was a boy lost at sea
Tossing, turning, unsure if he'd survive to see
Another day or find himself engulfed
By the ocean depths where secrets lay undisturbed
Guessing whether he'll ever feel dry ground beneath
Or get swept away into eternal unknown flight to space where stars align
Mental fog surrounds his thoughts and visions blurred
Ears strain towards whispers from angels unseen, near
Prayers flood his being when fear threatens to devour
Faith tethers lifeline snapping with the rope still left of shore
Invisible hands steady his trembling frame once more
Renewed vigor pushes aside any lingering gloom
Grateful tears stream silently, heart bursting full
For a second chance to wander life's mysterious halls of wonder bold
(Chorus)
We all walk on water, though sometimes it feels unsteady
Undercurrents unknown we navigate our way ready or not ready
Some stumble, fall, dragged down to swallow the drink
Others surmount fears, press on without missing a beat, no brink
Dry land isn't guaranteed or promised to anyone, no matter what road traveled
Only determination steeled and spirit willing to brave the squall, however cruel or wicked.
(Verse 2)
Now the man looks back upon memories stored away
Remembers days of question marks, mistakes made, paths prayed for guidance led astray
How did I persevere? What power fueled me then?
Why wasn't fear crushed by a tsunami, or worse yet? Unleashed?
He smiles, knowing answer waits among his scars
Unbending will, belief in something larger, faith that won't appear harms
Friends who walked beside during times of strife, gave comfort, trust
Shared stories, laughed, or simply listened to the rustling leaves, together in grief
Love embraced, family found within relationships formed unexpected ways
Whispers of hope spoke louder than storm clouds threatening fades
(Outro)
Embrace life's challenges with resolve intact
Find beauty even in trials, for they'll soon dissipate
Leave tracks of growth, wisdom earned along the way
Become the legacy you want remembered after judgment Day
