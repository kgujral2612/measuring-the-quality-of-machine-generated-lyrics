Here We Go Again

Verse 1 (Pre Chorus):
Another night under the moonlight
We'll unleash our passion, fire ignites
Dance until morning breaks out soon
When we hear familiar melodies from DJ tunes

Pre Chorus:
Every beat drops, hearts explode, we flow
Sing along, belting high and low
The rhythm takes hold deep within soul
Energy rises through each instrument bold

Chorus:
Here we go again, baby
Hands in the air, feel alive
One more time, we'll raise it higher
Until the end, we'll still defy

Bridge:
Memories blurred together, mixed emotions swirl
Fear may try, but won't get into
Our vibe of unity, pure devotion
This moment only happens once in a lifetime station

Chorus:
Here we go again, baby
Raisin' hell, we won't stray
No regrets left behind us, glory days remain
As the beat fades away, we'll stay the same... forever young

Breakdown/Post Crescendo:
So let's keep going strong
Forget yesterday's wrong
The future waits, but we've already conquered everything before it comes
Now, let's rock the floor one last time
Before leaving this place, just turn around
Embrace those nearby, shout it loud: "Thank you!"
Then slowly disperse back home to sweet dreams
