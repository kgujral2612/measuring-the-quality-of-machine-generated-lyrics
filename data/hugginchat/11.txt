Whispering Hope

Verse 1:
I hear your voice inside my head,
A tender word that brings me peace
The calm before the raging sea,
You are my anchor, never cease

Chorus:
Whispering hope, oh how it feels
To have someone who makes sense of this world
Who shows me kindness, and wipes away my tears,
This is what love's supposed to appear

Verse 2:
I feel your hand when I'm lost,
A comfort in chaos, hard to resist
Our bond that cannot be tossed,
A promise sealed since first impressions

Chorus:
Whispering hope, oh how it feels
To have someone who makes sense of this world
Who shows me kindness, and wipes away my tears,
This is what love's supposed to appear

Bridge:
Distance may keep us apart,
But memories keep us connected at heart
So when the night falls heavy,
Know I'll always hold onto this feeling of forever

Chorus:
Whispering hope, oh how it feels
To have someone who makes sense of this world
Who shows me kindness, and wipes away my tears,
This is what love's supposed to appear

Outro:
Oh, let me breathe in your name,
And cherish every single frame,
Then whisper back this tune,
Oh, I love you, 'til the end of time comes soon.
