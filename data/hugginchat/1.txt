A Little Light

(Verse 1)
Life can be tough sometimes, we all know that
Feeling lost, feeling low, and don’t have a map
We stumble through the dark, not knowing how to find our path
But there inside us burns a little spark, a tiny bit of life and light from God above
That glimmer shows the way for every step along this journey here below
It shines so bright that nothing else compares, no other thing, nor person, nor display
When darkness comes around you, just hold on tightly to your little light
Let it guide you forward, let it lead the fight.
Chorus:
Light up yourself, show them who you truly are
Shine forth in the world and share your love and care
In the endless night, keep burning strong
For everyone sees, but few take into account they need their own
Little light to make it through this time around, so turn it on! Don’t hide!
Spread joy throughout the land. Share love within hand.
Show your heart’s aflame and spreading warmth so kind.
Glow bright enough to guide the blind. Be the star in someone’s mind.
(Verse 2)
Hope might seem like such a fragile thing
So easy to dismiss and leave behind, hard to clutch as drift away
As if it were a feather floating by
Yet hope remains an anchor deep down inside, reminding why we must defy despair and rise
If all seems broken in bits, maybe it’s only because we forgot to give some pieces attention
Just one small effort makes a difference, adds strength back to the structure’s foundation
Take these moments, cherish each chance
To offer aid or listen well with wide open eyes and gentle voice
This gives hope a chance to bloom again. Let not a single soul miss out on hope and love.
Chorus:
Light up yourself, show them who you truly are
Shine forth in the world and share your love and care
In the endless night, keep burning strong
For everyone sees, but few take into account they need their own
Little light to make it through this time around, so turn it on! Don’t hide!
Spread joy throughout the land. Share love within hand.
Show your heart’s aflame and spreading warmth so kind.
