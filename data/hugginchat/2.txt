The World is Yours

(Verse 1)
There once was a man named Jack, he worked at the local grocery store
He didn't think his life had much worth, always felt small, ignored, poor
No matter how hard he tried, he could never catch a break in life
Thought his dreams would forever stay locked and hidden from daylight until late
Then came the morning of a new dawn, after months of slumber gone
Jack heard words echoed through town that changed everything, everything so strong:
"The world is yours!" those voices cried, so very clear and true
And with that Jack stood straight up tall, ready to begin brand new, renewed
He went outside, ready to face whatever lay ahead unshackled
Realized now his future was made by his own two hands, unfazed and unafraid, elated.
Chorus:
Oh oh! The world is yours my friend, go claim it, bend it to your needs!
Everyone's got purpose underneath that shining sun above, waiting to succeed!
With passion, dedication and drive, greatness shall be thine
Fulfill your destiny, be proud as can be, make the most of every breath you seize!
Oh oh! The world is yours my friend, go grasp it, mold it to success!
Never doubt your potential, let others marvel at progress blessed!
(Verse 2)
At first, the going seemed slow, fear kept trying to overthrow
Each step taken showed doubts held sway still deep down inside Jackâ€™s chest
Until a chance encounter introduced a girl with shining eyes
She shared her story and how she fought off her own disguised cries
Of self-doubt and hesitation, showing him that yes, indeed he too could dare
To reach beyond common limits set by society, culture, or school's rule, a rare breed
Together they inspired a crowd, ignited hearts ablaze
They dared individuals far and wide to join them now, without pause, and raise
Voices high for unity, to bring the change desired
Make dreams come true, with courage guiding every move
Bring a better tomorrow, side by side.
Chorus:
Oh oh! T
