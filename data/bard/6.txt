Despair

Verse 1:
I'm sitting here in the dark,
All alone with my thoughts.
I can't seem to shake this feeling of despair,
It's like a weight on my chest.

Chorus:
Despair, despair,
Why do you haunt me?
Despair, despair,
I can't escape you.

Verse 2:
I've lost everything that mattered to me,
My loved ones, my dreams, my hope.
I don't know what to do,
I feel like I'm going to die.

Chorus:
Despair, despair,
Why do you haunt me?
Despair, despair,
I can't escape you.

Bridge:
I know I'm not the only one who feels this way,
There are others out there who are just as lost and alone.
But we have to keep going,
We have to find a way to fight back against despair.

Chorus:
Despair, despair,
I won't let you win.
Despair, despair,
I will find a way to be happy again.

Outro:
I know it won't be easy,
But I'm not going to give up.
I will find a way to overcome this,
And I will find happiness again.
