You Are Not Alone

(Verse 1)
You feel like you're all alone
Like no one understands you
But I'm here to tell you
That you are not alone
(Chorus)
You are not alone
I'm here for you
I know what you're going through
And I'm here to help
(Verse 2)
You've been through so much
You've been hurt and you've been scared
But you're stronger than you think
And you can get through this
(Chorus)
You are not alone
I'm here for you
I know what you're going through
And I'm here to help
(Bridge)
You are not a burden
You are not a mistake
You are loved and you are cherished
And you are not alone
(Chorus)
You are not alone
I'm here for you
I know what you're going through
And I'm here to help
(Outro)
You are not alone
I'm here for you
And together, we can get through this
