Pride

(Verse 1)
I'm so proud of who I am,
I know I'm the best there is.
I'm better than everyone else,
And I don't care who knows it.

(Chorus)
I'm proud, I'm so proud,
I can't help but be proud.
I'm the best, I'm the best,
And there's no one else who can compare.

(Verse 2)
I'm proud of my accomplishments,
I'm proud of my looks,
I'm proud of my intelligence,
I'm proud of everything about me.

(Chorus)
I'm proud, I'm so proud,
I can't help but be proud.
I'm the best, I'm the best,
And there's no one else who can compare.

(Bridge)
But my pride can be a weakness,
It can make me arrogant,
It can make me think I'm better than everyone else,
And that can lead to trouble.

(Chorus)
I'm proud, I'm so proud,
But I know I need to be careful.
Pride can be a weakness,
But it can also be a strength.

(Outro)
I'm proud of who I am,
But I'm not going to let my pride get the best of me.
I'm going to use my pride to motivate me,
To push me to be the best I can be.
