Love Yourself

(Verse 1)
You've been through so much
You've been hurt and you've been lied to
But you still have to love yourself
No matter what anyone else says
(Chorus)
Love yourself, love yourself
No matter what they say
Love yourself, love yourself
You are worthy of love
(Verse 2)
You are beautiful, you are smart, you are kind
You are everything you need to be
So don't let anyone tell you otherwise
(Chorus)
Love yourself, love yourself
No matter what they say
Love yourself, love yourself
You are worthy of love
(Bridge)
You are the only person you have to live with for the rest of your life
So make sure you love yourself
(Chorus)
Love yourself, love yourself
No matter what they say
Love yourself, love yourself
You are worthy of love
(Outro)
Love yourself, and never let anyone tell you otherwise
