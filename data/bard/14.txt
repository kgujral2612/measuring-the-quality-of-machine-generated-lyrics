Let's Have a Party!

(Verse 1)
It's time to let loose and have some fun,
So let's get this party started!
We can dance the night away,
And sing our hearts out.

(Chorus)
Let's have a party,
Let's forget about our troubles,
And just have some fun!

(Verse 2)
We can eat, drink, and be merry,
And make new friends.
We can laugh until our sides hurt,
And dance until we can't dance anymore.

(Chorus)
Let's have a party,
Let's forget about our troubles,
And just have some fun!

(Bridge)
This is our time to let loose and be free,
So let's make the most of it!
We can do anything we want,
So let's make this party one to remember!

(Chorus)
Let's have a party,
Let's forget about our troubles,
And just have some fun!

(Outro)
This is our party,
And we're gonna make it a good one!
So let's dance, sing, laugh, and eat until we can't anymore!
Let's have a party!
