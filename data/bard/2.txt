Don't Give Up

(Verse 1)
When you feel like giving up
When you feel like you can't go on
Just remember that you're not alone
There are people who care about you

(Chorus)
Don't give up, don't give in
Keep fighting for what you believe in
You can do it, I believe in you
So don't give up, don't give in

(Verse 2)
It's not going to be easy
There will be times when you want to quit
But don't give up, keep going
You're stronger than you think

(Chorus)
Don't give up, don't give in
Keep fighting for what you believe in
You can do it, I believe in you
So don't give up, don't give in

(Bridge)
You are capable of anything you set your mind to
So don't let anyone tell you that you can't
You are strong, you are brave, and you are loved
So never give up on yourself

(Chorus)
Don't give up, don't give in
Keep fighting for what you believe in
You can do it, I believe in you
So don't give up, don't give in

(Outro)
Don't give up, keep going
You are stronger than you think
You can do it, I believe in you
So don't give up, don't give in
