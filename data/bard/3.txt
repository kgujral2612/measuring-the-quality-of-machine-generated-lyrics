Be Yourself

(Verse 1)
Don't try to be someone you're not
Just be yourself, and let your light shine
The world needs your unique perspective
So don't be afraid to be different
(Chorus)
Be yourself, be proud of who you are
Don't let anyone tell you that you can't
You are perfect just the way you are
So don't change for anyone
(Verse 2)
Don't be afraid to stand up for what you believe in
Even if it's not popular
The world needs more people who speak their truth
So be brave, and be yourself
(Chorus)
Be yourself, be proud of who you are
Don't let anyone tell you that you can't
You are perfect just the way you are
So don't change for anyone
(Bridge)
The world is a better place
When we all embrace our individuality
So don't be afraid to be yourself
The world needs you
(Chorus)
Be yourself, be proud of who you are
Don't let anyone tell you that you can't
You are perfect just the way you are
So don't change for anyone
(Outro)
Be yourself, and let your light shine
The world needs you
