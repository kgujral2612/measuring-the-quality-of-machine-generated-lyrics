The World is Yours

(Verse 1)
You're standing on the edge of a new beginning
The world is yours for the taking
So go out there and make your dreams come true
Don't let anyone tell you that you can't
(Chorus)
The world is yours
So go out and explore it
Find your passion and follow your dreams
The world is waiting for you
(Verse 2)
Don't be afraid to take risks
Step outside of your comfort zone
And see what the world has to offer
You might just be surprised
(Chorus)
The world is yours
So go out and explore it
Find your passion and follow your dreams
The world is waiting for you
(Bridge)
Don't let anyone tell you that you're not good enough
You are capable of anything you set your mind to
So go out there and show the world what you're made of
(Chorus)
The world is yours
So go out and explore it
Find your passion and follow your dreams
The world is waiting for you
(Outro)
The world is yours for the taking
So go out there and make it your own
