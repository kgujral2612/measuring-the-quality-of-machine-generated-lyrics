Love is a journey

Verse 1:
Love is a journey,
It's not always easy.
There will be ups and downs,
But it's worth it in the end.

Love is a journey,
And I'm glad to be on it with you.
I can't wait to see where it takes us,
I know it will be amazing.

Verse 2:
We've laughed together,
We've cried together,
We've grown together.
And I know that we'll continue to grow,
As long as we have each other.

Chorus:
Love is a journey,
And I'm glad to be on it with you.
I can't wait to see where it takes us,
I know it will be amazing.

Bridge:
I know that there will be times when we want to give up,
But I also know that we'll never give up on each other.
We're in this together,
And we'll get through it together.

Chorus:
Love is a journey,
And I'm glad to be on it with you.
I can't wait to see where it takes us,
I know it will be amazing.

I love you,
And I will always love you.
No matter what happens,
I will always be here for you.
