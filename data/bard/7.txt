The Sadness of Goodbye

(Verse 1)
I can't believe you're gone,
It feels like just yesterday we were together.
I still remember the way you made me laugh,
And the way you always knew how to make me feel better.

(Chorus)
But now you're gone,
And I'm left with nothing but the sadness of goodbye.
I don't know how to go on without you,
But I know I have to try.

(Verse 2)
I'll never forget you,
And I'll always cherish the memories we made together.
You'll always have a special place in my heart,
And I'll never stop loving you.

(Chorus)
But now you're gone,
And I'm left with nothing but the sadness of goodbye.
I don't know how to go on without you,
But I know I have to try.

(Bridge)
I know it's going to take time,
But I'll eventually learn to live without you.
I'll never forget you,
But I'll find a way to move on.

(Chorus)
Because now you're gone,
And I'm left with nothing but the sadness of goodbye.
I don't know how to go on without you,
But I know I have to try.
