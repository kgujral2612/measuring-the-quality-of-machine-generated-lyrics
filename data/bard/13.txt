Greedy

(Verse 1)
I always want more,
I can never be satisfied.
I'm always looking for the next big thing,
The next way to make more money,
The next way to get more power.

(Chorus)
I'm greedy, I'm so greedy,
I can't help but be greedy.
I always want more,
And I'll never be satisfied.

(Verse 2)
My greed has made me do things I'm not proud of,
I've lied, I've cheated, I've stolen,
I've done anything to get what I want.

(Chorus)
I'm greedy, I'm so greedy,
I can't help but be greedy.
I always want more,
And I'll never be satisfied.

(Bridge)
I know my greed is a problem,
But I don't know how to stop it.
I'm addicted to the feeling of getting more,
I'm addicted to the power that comes with it.

(Chorus)
I'm greedy, I'm so greedy,
I can't help but be greedy.
I always want more,
And I'll never be satisfied.

(Outro)
I'm so greedy,
I'm going to ruin myself.
I'm going to lose everything,
And it's all my fault.
