Love is all I need

(Verse 1)
I've been searching for something,
Something to fill this empty space.
I've tried money, power, and fame,
But they all left me feeling disgraced.

(Chorus)
But now I know what I need,
It's all right here in front of me.
Love is all I need,
To make my life complete.

(Verse 2)
I used to think that I was strong,
But I was only fooling myself.
I needed someone to hold me close,
And tell me that everything was going to be okay.

(Chorus)
But now I know what I need,
It's all right here in front of me.
Love is all I need,
To make my life complete.

(Bridge)
I've finally found my place in the world,
And it's all because of you.
You've shown me what true love is,
And I'll never be the same.

(Chorus)
So thank you for loving me,
For making me feel complete.
Love is all I need,
And I'll never let you go.
