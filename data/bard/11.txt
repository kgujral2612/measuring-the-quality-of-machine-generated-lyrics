Love is all I need

Verse 1:
Love is a battlefield,
Full of pain and sorrow.
But it's also a place of hope,
Where dreams can come true.

Chorus:
Love is a battlefield,
But I'm ready to fight.
I'm not afraid of the scars,
Because I know that love is worth it.

Verse 2:
I've been hurt before,
But I've learned from my mistakes.
I'm not going to let fear hold me back,
I'm going to keep fighting for love.

Chorus:
Love is a battlefield,
But I'm ready to fight.
I'm not afraid of the scars,
Because I know that love is worth it.

Bridge:
I know that love is not easy,
But it's the most important thing in the world.
It's worth fighting for,
Even if it means getting hurt.

Chorus:
Love is a battlefield,
But I'm ready to fight.
I'm not afraid of the scars,
Because I know that love is worth it.

Outro:
I'm going to keep fighting for love,
Until I find the one who's meant for me.
I know that love is out there,
And I'm not going to give up until I find it.
