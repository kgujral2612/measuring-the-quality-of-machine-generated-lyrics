The Despair of Loneliness

(Verse 1)
I'm so lonely,
I feel like I'm the only person in the world.
I'm surrounded by people,
But I feel so alone.

(Chorus)
I'm in despair,
I don't know what to do.
I'm so lonely,
I just want to be loved.

(Verse 2)
I've tried to reach out,
But no one seems to care.
I'm starting to lose hope,
I don't know how much longer I can go on.

(Chorus)
I'm in despair,
I don't know what to do.
I'm so lonely,
I just want to be loved.

(Bridge)
I know I'm not the only one who feels this way,
There are others out there who are just as lonely as I am.
But we have to keep going,
We have to find a way to connect with each other.

(Chorus)
We're not in despair,
We can do this.
We're not so lonely,
We can find love.

(Outro)
Together, we can overcome anything.
We are not alone.
