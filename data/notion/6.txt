Broken Dreams

Verse 1:
I'm sitting here alone, no one to call my own
All the dreams I had, shattered like a stone
Thinking 'bout the times, when you were by my side
Now the memories haunt me, I've got nowhere to hide

Chorus:
Broken dreams, shattered heart
Wish we never had to part
Tears falling down like rain
Won't wash away the pain

Verse 2:
Now I'm lost in time, searching for a sign
Trying to find my way, in this life of mine
Thinking 'bout the times, when you were by my side
Now the memories haunt me, I've got nowhere to hide

Chorus:
Broken dreams, shattered heart
Wish we never had to part
Tears falling down like rain
Won't wash away the pain

Bridge:
Every night I pray, for a brighter day
Hoping you'll come back to me, and take this pain away

Chorus:
Broken dreams, shattered heart
Wish we never had to part
Tears falling down like rain
Won't wash away the pain

Outro:
Broken dreams, shattered heart
Wish we never had to part
Tears falling down like rain
Won't wash away the pain
