Keep Moving Forward

Verse 1:
Life is full of twists and turns
And we can't avoid the bumps and burns
But I know that every step we take
Will lead us to a better place

Chorus:
Keep moving forward, don't give up
Keep moving forward, fill your cup
Keep moving forward, one step at a time
Keep moving forward, let your light shine

Verse 2:
We all have our own unique path
And it's easy to get lost in the aftermath
But we have to keep on going
And keep the fire glowing

Chorus:
Keep moving forward, don't give up
Keep moving forward, fill your cup
Keep moving forward, one step at a time
Keep moving forward, let your light shine

Bridge:
It's easy to get caught up in the past
And forget that every day can be a blast
But we have to keep our eyes on the prize
And let go of the things that weigh us down inside

Chorus:
Keep moving forward, don't give up
Keep moving forward, fill your cup
Keep moving forward, one step at a time
Keep moving forward, let your light shine

Outro:
Keep moving forward, don't look back
Keep moving forward, stay on track
Keep moving forward, you've got this
Keep moving forward, let love and light persist
