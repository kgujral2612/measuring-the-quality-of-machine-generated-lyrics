Chasing Dreams

Verse 1:
I'm on a journey to find my way
To chase the dreams that I can't shake
I don't know what the future holds
But I won't let go of my goals

Chorus:
Chasing dreams, it's what we do
Chasing dreams, they'll come true
Chasing dreams, we'll find our way
Chasing dreams, every day

Verse 2:
I'm climbing mountains and crossing seas
I'm facing fears and insecurities
I don't know what's around the bend
But I know I'll reach the end

Chorus:
Chasing dreams, it's what we do
Chasing dreams, they'll come true
Chasing dreams, we'll find our way
Chasing dreams, every day

Bridge:
It's easy to get lost in the fray
And forget why we're here today
But we have to keep on going
And keep the fire glowing

Chorus:
Chasing dreams, it's what we do
Chasing dreams, they'll come true
Chasing dreams, we'll find our way
Chasing dreams, every day

Outro:
Chasing dreams, it's our destiny
Chasing dreams, we'll set them free
Chasing dreams, let's seize the day
Chasing dreams, come what may
