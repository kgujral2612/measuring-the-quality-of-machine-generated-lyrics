The Temptation

Verse 1:
Pride, the temptation that blinds the eye.
A feeling of superiority that makes us fly.
Thinking 'bout the times, when we were kings,
But the pride inside us, it's the devil's wings.

Chorus:
The temptation, it's hard to resist.
The feeling of being the best, always persists.
Can't escape this feeling of superiority,
It's the devil's game, a game of futility.

Verse 2:
Greed, the temptation that enslaves the soul.
A desire for wealth, that makes us lose control.
Thinking 'bout the times, when we were poor,
But the greed inside us, it's the devil's lure.

Chorus:
The temptation, it's hard to resist.
The feeling of being rich, always persists.
Can't escape this feeling of greed,
It's the devil's game, a game of need.

Bridge:
Every night I pray, for a brighter day.
Hoping to escape, the devil's way.

Chorus:
The temptation, it's hard to resist.
The feeling of being the best, always persists.
Can't escape this feeling of superiority,
It's the devil's game, a game of futility.
