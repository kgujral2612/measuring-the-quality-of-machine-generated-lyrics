Fading Memories

Verse 1:
Memories of you, still haunt me every day
Can't escape this pain, no matter what I say
Thinking 'bout the times, when we were together
Now it's all gone, and I'm lost forever

Chorus:
Fading memories, heart so heavy
Wishing for a love that's steady
Can't escape this pain, it's too much to carry
Fading memories, heart so heavy

Verse 2:
Now I'm all alone, with nothing left to hold
Trying to find my way, in this world so cold
Thinking 'bout the times, when we were together
Now it's all gone, and I'm lost forever

Chorus:
Fading memories, heart so heavy
Wishing for a love that's steady
Can't escape this pain, it's too much to carry
Fading memories, heart so heavy

Bridge:
Every night I pray, for a brighter day
Hoping you'll come back to me, and take this pain away

Chorus:
Fading memories, heart so heavy
Wishing for a love that's steady
Can't escape this pain, it's too much to carry
Fading memories, heart so heavy

Outro:
Fading memories, heart so heavy
Wishing for a love that's steady
Can't escape this pain, it's too much to carry
Fading memories, heart so heavy
