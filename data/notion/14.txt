The night is young, the lights are bright,
The music's thumping, it's just right.
The drinks are flowing, the vibe is tight,
We're all here, to party tonight.

Let's party, let's dance all night,
Let's forget our worries, and just feel alright.
Let's live it up, let's have some fun,
Let's party, till the morning sun.

Verse 2:
The DJ's spinning, the beats are hot,
We're moving our bodies, we're giving it all we've got.
The crowd is jumping, the energy's high,
We're all here, to party till we die.

Let's party, let's dance all night,
Let's forget our worries, and just feel alright.
Let's live it up, let's have some fun,
Let's party, till the morning sun.

Bridge:
Every night's a party, when we're all together,
We'll dance and sing, and forget the weather.
We'll make memories, that will last forever,
We'll party like there's no tomorrow, we'll party together.

Let's party, let's dance all night,
Let's forget our worries, and just feel alright.
Let's live it up, let's have some fun,
Let's party, till the morning sun.

Let's party, let's dance all night,
Let's forget our worries, and just feel alright.
Let's live it up, let's have some fun,
Let's party, till the morning sun.
