Stay With Me

Verse 1:
Lost in my thoughts, you're all I see
Can't escape this feeling, that you're meant to be
Thinking 'bout the times, when we were apart
Now I've got you, you're the missing piece of my heart

Chorus:
Stay with me, till the end of time
I'll be there for you, forever mine
Together we'll conquer, every mountain, every climb
Stay with me, till the end of time

Verse 2:
Now I'm all alone, with nothing left to hold
Trying to find my way, in a world so cold
Thinking 'bout the times, when we were apart
Now I've got you, you're the missing piece of my heart

Chorus:
Stay with me, till the end of time
I'll be there for you, forever mine
Together we'll conquer, every mountain, every climb
Stay with me, till the end of time

Bridge:
Every night I pray, for a love that's true
Hoping you'll be mine, forever and ever too

Chorus:
Stay with me, till the end of time
I'll be there for you, forever mine
Together we'll conquer, every mountain, every climb
Stay with me, till the end of time

Outro:
Stay with me, till the end of time
I'll be there for you, forever mine
