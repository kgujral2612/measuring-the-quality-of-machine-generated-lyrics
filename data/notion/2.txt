Embrace the Change

Verse 1:
I'm standing on the edge of something new
A world I've never seen
I'm scared of what the future holds
But I know I have to lean

Chorus:
Embrace the change, don't be afraid
Embrace the change, it's time to be brave
Embrace the change, take a chance
Embrace the change, let's start this dance

Verse 2:
I've been stuck in the same old place
Afraid to take a risk
But I know that nothing stays the same
And I can't resist

Chorus:
Embrace the change, don't be afraid
Embrace the change, it's time to be brave
Embrace the change, take a chance
Embrace the change, let's start this dance

Bridge:
It's easy to stay where we are
And never take a chance
But life is full of twists and turns
And we have to take a stance

Chorus:
Embrace the change, don't be afraid
Embrace the change, it's time to be brave
Embrace the change, take a chance
Embrace the change, let's start this dance

Outro:
Embrace the change, it's time to move on
Embrace the change, let's sing a new song
Embrace the change, let's start today
Embrace the change, let's find our way
