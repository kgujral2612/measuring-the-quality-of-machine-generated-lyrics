Endless Sorrow

Verse 1:
Lost in my thoughts, drowning in sorrow
Can't escape this pain, that I feel tomorrow
Thinking 'bout the times, when you were here
Now the memories haunt me, and it's all so clear

Chorus:
Endless sorrow, heart so hollow
Wishing for a brighter tomorrow
Can't escape this pain, it's hard to swallow
Endless sorrow, heart so hollow

Verse 2:
Now I'm all alone, in this world so cold
Trying to find my way, but I'm losing hold
Thinking 'bout the times, when you were here
Now the memories haunt me, and it's all so clear

Chorus:
Endless sorrow, heart so hollow
Wishing for a brighter tomorrow
Can't escape this pain, it's hard to swallow
Endless sorrow, heart so hollow

Bridge:
Every night I pray, for a brighter day
Hoping you'll come back to me, and take this pain away

Chorus:
Endless sorrow, heart so hollow
Wishing for a brighter tomorrow
Can't escape this pain, it's hard to swallow
Endless sorrow, heart so hollow

Outro:
Endless sorrow, heart so hollow
Wishing for a brighter tomorrow
Can't escape this pain, it's hard to swallow
Endless sorrow, heart so hollow
