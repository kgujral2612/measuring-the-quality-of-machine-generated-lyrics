Notion

Verse 1:
I've got this notion in my head
A thought that won't escape
It swirls around, it fills me up
And it won't let me escape

Chorus:
Notion, notion, what's the plan?
Notion, notion, can you understand?
Notion, notion, it won't let me be
Notion, notion, please set me free

Verse 2:
I try to push it to the side
But it's always on my mind
It whispers to me in my dreams
And it's getting hard to find

Chorus:
Notion, notion, what's the plan?
Notion, notion, can you understand?
Notion, notion, it won't let me be
Notion, notion, please set me free

Bridge:
I don't know where this notion leads
But I know I have to be
Strong enough to face the truth
And let it set me free

Chorus:
Notion, notion, what's the plan?
Notion, notion, can you understand?
Notion, notion, it won't let me be
Notion, notion, please set me free

Outro:
Notion, notion, I'll face the fear
Notion, notion, I'll let it clear
Notion, notion, I'll find my way
Notion, notion, I'll seize the day
