Good Times

Verse 1:
Good times, we're having fun,
We're living life, like it's just begun.
The music's playing, the drinks are flowing,
We're all here, and the good times are growing.

Chorus:
Good times, we'll never forget,
Memories that we'll treasure, forever yet.
We'll dance and sing, and have some fun,
Good times, till the morning sun.

Verse 2:
The party's roaring, the crowd's alive,
We're feeling free, we're feeling alive.
The night's young, and so are we,
We'll party hard, till we're all free.

Chorus:
Good times, we'll never forget,
Memories that we'll treasure, forever yet.
We'll dance and sing, and have some fun,
Good times, till the morning sun.

Bridge:
Every night's a party, every day's a new adventure,
We'll make the most of it, with every single gesture.
We'll make memories, that will last forever,
We'll party like there's no tomorrow, we'll party together.

Chorus:
Good times, we'll never forget,
Memories that we'll treasure, forever yet.
We'll dance and sing, and have some fun,
Good times, till the morning sun.

Outro:
Good times, we'll never forget,
Memories that we'll treasure, forever yet.
We'll dance and sing, and have some fun,
Good times, till the morning sun.
