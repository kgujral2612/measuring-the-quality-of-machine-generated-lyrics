The Road Ahead

Verse 1:
I'm standing at the crossroads of my life
A path I've never seen
I'm scared of what the future holds
But I know I have to lean

Chorus:
The road ahead, it's long and winding
The road ahead, my heart is binding
The road ahead, it's time to be strong
The road ahead, I'll keep moving on

Verse 2:
I've been through many ups and downs
The journey has been rough
But I know that every step I take
Will lead me to the stuff

Chorus:
The road ahead, it's long and winding
The road ahead, my heart is binding
The road ahead, it's time to be strong
The road ahead, I'll keep moving on

Bridge:
It's easy to get lost in life
And never find our way
But we have to keep on going
And seize the day

Chorus:
The road ahead, it's long and winding
The road ahead, my heart is binding
The road ahead, it's time to be strong
The road ahead, I'll keep moving on

Outro:
The road ahead, it's full of light
The road ahead, it's worth the fight
The road ahead, let's start today
The road ahead, let's find our way
