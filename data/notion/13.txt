The Seven Sins

Verse 1:
Wrath, the sin that consumes the heart.
A feeling of anger, that tears us apart.
Thinking 'bout the times, when we were calm,
But the wrath inside us, it's the devil's bomb.

Chorus:
The seven sins, they're hard to ignore.
The feeling of anger, it's hard to restore.
Can't escape this feeling of hate,
It's the devil's game, a game of fate.

Verse 2:
Lust, the sin that enslaves the mind.
A desire for pleasure, that makes us blind.
Thinking 'bout the times, when we were pure,
But the lust inside us, it's the devil's lure.

Chorus:
The seven sins, they're hard to ignore.
The feeling of pleasure, it's hard to restore.
Can't escape this feeling of lust,
It's the devil's game, a game of trust.

Bridge:
Every night I pray, for a brighter day.
Hoping to escape, the devil's way.

Chorus:
The seven sins, they're hard to ignore.
The feeling of anger, it's hard to restore.
Can't escape this feeling of hate,
It's the devil's game, a game of fate.

Outro:
The seven sins, they're hard to ignore.
The feeling of pleasure, it's hard to restore.
Can't escape this feeling of hate,
It's the devil's game, a game of fate.
