Lost in Time

Verse 1:
I'm lost in time, can't find my way
I'm searching for a place to stay
The world is spinning, I'm losing my mind
I'm trying to find something to bind

Chorus:
Lost in time, can't find my way
Lost in time, searching for a place to stay
Lost in time, I'm losing my mind
Lost in time, trying to find something to bind

Verse 2:
I'm looking for love, in a world of hate
I'm searching for a way to escape
The clock is ticking, and I'm running out of time
I'm trying to find a reason to climb

Chorus:
Lost in time, can't find my way
Lost in time, searching for a place to stay
Lost in time, I'm losing my mind
Lost in time, trying to find something to bind

Bridge:
But in this moment, I'm grateful for what I have
I'm alive, I'm breathing, and that's enough
I'll keep on searching, I'll keep on trying
And someday, I'll find what I'm looking for

Chorus:
Lost in time, can't find my way
Lost in time, searching for a place to stay
Lost in time, I'm losing my mind
Lost in time, trying to find something to bind

Outro:
Lost in time, I'm lost in time
Lost in time, but I'll keep on trying
Lost in time, I'm lost in time
Lost in time, but I'll keep on climbing.
