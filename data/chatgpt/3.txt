The Light Within

Verse 1:
Lost in the darkness, searching for a way
Feeling so hopeless, can't see the light of day
But deep down inside, there's a burning flame
A light that shines bright, calling out your name

Chorus:
The light within, it's always there
Guiding you through, the depths of despair
Don't give up, don't lose your way
Let the light within, lead you to a brighter day

Verse 2:
Life can be tough, and it can bring you down
But don't let it break you, don't let it steal your crown
For every storm, there's a silver lining
And every challenge, is just a chance for shining

Chorus:
The light within, it's always there
Guiding you through, the depths of despair
Don't give up, don't lose your way
Let the light within, lead you to a brighter day

Bridge:
It's easy to forget, the power that we hold
To rise above, and be brave and bold
So when you feel lost, and the world seems cold
Remember the light within, and let it unfold

Chorus:
The light within, it's always there
Guiding you through, the depths of despair
Don't give up, don't lose your way
Let the light within, lead you to a brighter day

Outro:
The light within, it's always shining bright
A beacon of hope, in the darkest of night
So hold on tight, and never let it go
Let the light within, be your guiding glow.
