Choose Love

Verse 1:
We live in a world where it's easy to hate
Where anger and fear seem to dominate
But I know there's a choice we can make
To spread love instead of hate

Chorus:
Choose love, when the world seems tough
Choose love, when the road is rough
Choose love, it's the only way
To make a better world today

Verse 2:
It's so easy to be cynical
To believe that love is too difficult
But I know it's worth the fight
To spread love with all our might

Chorus:
Choose love, when the world seems tough
Choose love, when the road is rough
Choose love, it's the only way
To make a better world today

Bridge:
Love can change everything
It's the power we all bring
We can make a difference, you and me
Just choose love, and you'll see

Chorus:
Choose love, when the world seems tough
Choose love, when the road is rough
Choose love, it's the only way
To make a better world today

Outro:
It's time to break the hate chain
Spread love, let it reign
Together we can make a brighter day
Just choose love, every step of the way.
