The Road Ahead

Verse 1:
I'm standing at the crossroads
Wondering which way to go
The path ahead is uncertain
And the future's unknown

Chorus:
But I'll keep on moving forward
With my head held high
I'll face the challenges that come my way
And never say die

Verse 2:
The journey may be long
And the road may be rough
But I'll keep on walking
Till I've had enough

Chorus:
But I'll keep on moving forward
With my head held high
I'll face the challenges that come my way
And never say die

Bridge:
I know there'll be obstacles
And I'll stumble and fall
But I'll get back up again
And keep giving my all

Chorus:
But I'll keep on moving forward
With my head held high
I'll face the challenges that come my way
And never say die

Outro:
The road ahead may be tough
But I'll keep on walking
With faith in my heart
And hope in my soul.
