Memories of You

Verse 1:
I close my eyes and see your face
The memories of you, I can't erase
The love we shared, now just a dream
My heart is shattered, it seems

Chorus:
Memories of you, haunting me
The pain inside, won't set me free
I miss you more than words can say
My heart aches every single day

Verse 2:
The laughter we shared, the tears we cried
The moments we cherished, now all gone by
I wish I could turn back time
And hold you close, just one more time

Chorus:
Memories of you, haunting me
The pain inside, won't set me free
I miss you more than words can say
My heart aches every single day

Bridge:
I know I have to let you go
But it's so hard, you know
I'll keep your memories alive
And cherish them, until the end of time

Chorus:
Memories of you, haunting me
The pain inside, won't set me free
I miss you more than words can say
My heart aches every single day

Outro:
Memories of you, forever in my heart
I'll love you always, even though we're apart.
