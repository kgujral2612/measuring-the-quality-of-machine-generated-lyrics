The Price We Pay

Verse 1:
Pride, the ego that we feed
We think we're better, we don't concede
Greed, the hunger that we breed
We want it all, we don't take heed

Chorus:
The price we pay, it's never enough
The seven vices, they're so tough
We're only human, we make mistakes
But we can change, before it's too late

Verse 2:
Wrath, the anger that we unleash
We hurt others, we don't appease
Envy, the jealousy that we seize
We want what others have, we don't please

Chorus:
The price we pay, it's never enough
The seven vices, they're so tough
We're only human, we make mistakes
But we can change, before it's too late

Verse 3:
Lust, the desire that we crave
We lose our morals, we don't behave
Gluttony, the excess that we save
We indulge too much, we don't behave

Chorus:
The price we pay, it's never enough
The seven vices, they're so tough
We're only human, we make mistakes
But we can change, before it's too late

Verse 4:
Sloth, the laziness that we embrace
We procrastinate, we don't face
The seven vices, they're all around
But we can overcome, we can be unbound

Chorus:
The price we pay, it's never enough
The seven vices, they're so tough
We're only human, we make mistakes
But we can change, before it's too late

Outro:
The price we pay, it's not worth it
The seven vices, they don't permit
We can be better, we can be kind
We can leave the vices, we can unwind.
