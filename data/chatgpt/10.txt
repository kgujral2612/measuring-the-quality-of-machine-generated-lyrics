A love so strong, it can never be halved
Together we'll conquer the world, side by side

But our love has always remained
We've grown together, we've learned to forgive

A love so strong, it can never be halved
Together we'll conquer the world, side by side

It's a flame that will never be extinguished
We'll hold on tight, we'll never let go
Our love will continue to grow and glow

A love so strong, it can never be halved
Together we'll conquer the world, side by side
